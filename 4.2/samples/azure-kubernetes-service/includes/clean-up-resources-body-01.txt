If you used the automation script, the output from the `create-domain-on-aks.sh` script includes a statement about the Azure resources created by the script. To delete the cluster and free all related resources, simply delete the resource groups. The output will list the resource groups, such as:

```shell
The following Azure Resources have been created:
  Resource groups: wlsresourcegroup6091605169, MC_wlsresourcegroup6091605169_wlsakscluster6091605169_eastus
```

Given the above output, the following Azure CLI commands will delete the resource groups.

```shell
$ az group delete --yes --no-wait --name wlsresourcegroup6091605169
```
