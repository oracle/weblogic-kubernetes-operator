### Watch package

The Watch API in the Kubernetes Java client provides a watch capability across a specific list of resources for a limited amount of time. As such, it is not ideally suited for our use case, where a continuous stream of watches is desired, with watch events generated in real time. The watch-wrapper in this repository extends the default Watch API to provide a continuous stream of watch events until the stream is specifically closed. It also provides `resourceVersion` tracking to exclude events that have already been seen.  The watch-wrapper provides callbacks so events, as they occur, can trigger actions.
