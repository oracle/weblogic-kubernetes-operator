> My domain will not start and I see errors like `ImagePullBackoff` or `Cannot pull image`

When you see these kinds of errors, it means that Kubernetes cannot find your Docker image.
The most common causes are:

* The `image` value in your domain resource is set incorrectly, meaning Kubernetes will be
  trying to pull the wrong image.
* The image requires authentication or permission in order to pull it and you have not
  configured Kubernetes with the necessary credentials, for example in an `imagePullSecret`.
* You built the image on a machine that is not where your `kubelet` is running and Kubernetes
  cannot see the image, meaning you need to copy the image to the worker nodes or put it in
  a Docker registry that is accessible the to all of the worker nodes.

Let's review what happens when Kubernetes starts a pod.

![Pulling an image](/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/images/image-pull.png)

The definition of the pod contains a list of container specifications.  Each container
specification contains the name (and optionally, tag) of the image that should be used
to run that container.  In the example above, there is a container called `c1` which is
configured to use the Docker image `some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0`.  This image
name is in the format `registry address / owner / name : tag`, so in this case the
registry is `some.registry.com`, the owner is `owner`, the image name is `domain`
and the tag is `1.0`.  Tags are a lot like version numbers, but they are not required
to be numbers or to be in any particular sequence or format.  If you omit the tag, it
is assumed to be `latest`.

{{% notice note %}}
The Docker tag `latest` is confusing - it does not actually mean the latest version of
the image that was created or published in the registry; it just literally means
whichever version the owner decided to call "latest".  Docker and Kubernetes make
some assumptions about latest, and it is generally recommended to avoid using it and instead
specify the actual version or tag that you really want.
{{% /notice %}}

First, Kubernetes will check to see if the requested image is available in the local
Docker image store on whichever worker node the pod was scheduled on.  If it is there,
then it will use that image to start the container.  If it is not there, then Kubernetes
will attempt to pull the image from a remote Docker registry.

{{% notice note %}}
There is another setting called `imagePullPolicy` that can be used to force Kubernetes
to always pull the image, even if it is already present in the local Docker image
store.
{{% /notice %}}

If the image is available in the remote registry and it is public, that is it does not
require authentication, then Kubernetes will pull the image to the local Docker image
store and start the container.

#### Images that require authentication

If the remote Docker registry requires authentication, then you will need to provide
the authentication details in a Kubernetes `docker-registry` secret and tell Kubernetes
to use that secret when pulling the image.

To create a secret, you can use the following command:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry secret1 \
        --docker-server=some.registry.com \
        --docker-username=bob \
        --docker-password=bigSecret \
        --docker-email=bob@some.com \
        --namespace=default
```

In this command, you would replace `secret1` with the name of the secret; the `docker-server`
is set to the registry name, without the `https://` prefix; the `docker-username`, `docker-password`
and `docker-email` are set to match the credentials you use to authenticate to the remote
Docker registry; and the `namespace` must be set to the same namespace where you intend to
use the image.

{{% notice note %}}
Some registries may need a suffix making the `docker-server` something like `some.registry.com/v2`
for example.  You will need to check with your registry provider's documentation to determine if this is needed.
{{% /notice %}}

After the secret is created, you need to tell Kubernetes to use it.  This is done by adding
an `imagePullSecret` to your Kubernetes YAML file.  In the case of a WebLogic domain, you
add the secret name to the `imagePullSecret` in the domain custom resource YAML file.  

Here is an example of part of a domain custom resource file with the `imagePullSecret` above
specified:

```
apiVersion: "weblogic.oracle/v8"
kind: Domain
metadata:
  name: domain1
  namespace: default
  labels:
    weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2
    weblogic.domainUID: domain1
spec:
  domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/domain1
  domainHomeSourceType: Image
  image: "some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0"
  imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: secret1
```

Alternatively, you can associate the secret with the service account that will be used to run
the pod.  If you do this, then you will not need to add the `imagePullSecret` to the domain
resource.  This is useful if you are running multiple domains in the same namespace.

To add the secret shown above to the `default` service account in the `weblogic` namespace, you
would use a command like this:

```
kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
        -n weblogic \
        -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "secret1"}]}'
```

{{% notice note %}}
You can provide multiple `imagePullSecrets` if you need to pull Docker images from multiple
remote Docker registries or if your images require different authentication credentials.

#### Pushing the image to a repository

If you have an image in your local repository that you would like to copy to
a remote repository, then the Docker steps are:

- Use [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)
  to log in to the target repository's registry. For example: 
  ```
  docker login some.registry.com -u username -p password
  ```
- Use [docker tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/)
  to mark the image with the target registry, owner, repository name, and tag.
  For example:
  ```
  docker tag domain1:1.0 some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0
  ```
- Use [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/)
  to push the image to the repository. For example:
  ```
  docker push some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0
  ```

#### Manually copying the image to your worker nodes

If you are not able to use a remote Docker registry, for example if your Kubernetes cluster is
in a secure network with no external access, then you can manually copy the Docker images to the
cluster instead.

On the machine where you created the image, export it into a TAR file using this command:

```
docker save domain1:1.0 > domain1.tar
```

Then copy that TAR file to each worker node in your Kubernetes cluster and run this command
on each node:

```
docker load < domain1.tar
```

#### Restart pods to clear the error

After you have ensured that the images are accessible on all worker nodes, you may need to restart
the pods so that Kubernetes will attempt to pull the images again.   You can do this by
deleting the pods themselves, or deleting the domain resource and then recreating it.
