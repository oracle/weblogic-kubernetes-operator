To support Fast Application Notifications (FAN), Oracle databases configure GRID (Oracle Grid Infrastructure).
GRID is typically associated with (and required by) Oracle RAC databases but can
also be used in other configurations.  Oracle Autonomous Database-Serverless (ATP-S) does not provide GRID.

When connecting to a database that does not have GRID, the only type of WebLogic Server
data source that is supported is the Generic Data Sources. Multi Data Sources and Active GridLink
data sources cannot be used because they work with RAC.


WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 shipped with the 12.2.0.1 Oracle driver. When connecting
with this driver to a database that does not have GRID, you will
encounter the following exception (however, the 18.3 driver does not have this problem):

```
oracle.simplefan.impl.FanManager configure
SEVERE: attempt to configure ONS in FanManager failed with oracle.ons.NoServersAvailable: Subscription time out
```

To correct the problem, you must disable FAN, in one of two places:

1)	Through a system property at the domain, cluster, or server level.  

To do this, edit the Domain Custom Resource to set the system property `oracle.jdbc.fanEnabled`
to `false` as shown in the following example:

```
  serverPod:
    # an (optional) list of environment variable to be set on the servers
    env:
    - name: JAVA_OPTIONS
      value: "-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false -Doracle.jdbc.fanEnabled=false"
    - name: WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES
      value: "-Doracle.jdbc.fanEnabled=false"
```

2) Configure the data source connection pool properties.  

The following WLST script adds the
 `oracle.jdbc.fanEnabled` property, set to `false`, to an existing data source.

```
       fmwDb = 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@' + db
       print 'fmwDatabase  ' + fmwDb
       cd('/JDBCSystemResource/LocalSvcTblDataSource/JdbcResource/LocalSvcTblDataSource')
       cd('JDBCDriverParams/NO_NAME_0')
       set('DriverName', 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver')
       set('URL', fmwDb)
       set('PasswordEncrypted', dbPassword)

       stbUser = dbPrefix + '_STB'
       cd('Properties/NO_NAME_0/Property/user')
       set('Value', stbUser)
       ls()
       cd('../..')
       ls()
       create('oracle.jdbc.fanEnabled','Property')
       ls()
       cd('Property/oracle.jdbc.fanEnabled')
       set('Value', 'false')
       ls()
```
After changing the data source connection pool configuration, for the attribute to take effect,
make sure to undeploy and redeploy the data source, or restart WebLogic Server.
