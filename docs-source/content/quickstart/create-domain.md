1. Create a Kubernetes secret containing the `username` and `password` for the domain using the [`create-weblogic-credentials`](http://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials/create-weblogic-credentials.sh) script:

    ```bash
    $ kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials/create-weblogic-credentials.sh \
      -u weblogic -p welcome1 -n sample-domain1-ns -d sample-domain1
    ```

    The sample will create a secret named `domainUID-weblogic-credentials` where the `domainUID` is replaced
    with the value you provided.  For example, the command above would create a secret named
    `sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials`.

1.	Create a new image with a domain home by running the [`create-domain`](http://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image/create-domain.sh) script.
Follow the directions in the [README](http://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image/README.md) file,
including:

    * Copying the sample `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image/create-domain-inputs.yaml` file and updating your copy with the `domainUID` (`sample-domain1`),
domain namespace (`sample-domain1-ns`), and the `domainHomeImageBase` (`store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3`).

    * Setting `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` to the name of the secret containing the WebLogic credentials, in this case, `sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials`.

    * Leaving the `image` empty unless you need to tag the new image that the script builds to a different name.
{{% notice note %}}
If you set the `domainHomeImageBuildPath` property to `./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt`, make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` is set to a Java JDK version 1.8 or later.
{{% /notice %}}

    For example, assuming you named your copy `my-inputs.yaml`:

    ```bash
    $ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image
    $ ./create-domain.sh -i my-inputs.yaml -o /some/output/directory -u weblogic -p welcome1 -e
    ```

    You need to provide the WebLogic administration user name and password in the `-u` and `-p` options
    respectively, as shown in the example.
{{% notice note %}}
When using this sample, the WebLogic Server credentials that you specify, in three separate places, must be consistent:

- The secret that you create for the credentials.
- The properties files in the sample project you choose to create the Docker image from.
- The parameters you supply to the `create-domain.sh` script.
{{% /notice %}}


    If you specify the `-e` option, the script will generate the
    Kubernetes YAML files *and* apply them to your cluster.  If you omit the `-e` option, the
    script will just generate the YAML files, but will not take any action on your cluster.

    If you run the sample from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster, and you need to push the new image to a registry that is local to the cluster, you need to do the following:

    * Set the `image` property in the inputs file to the target image name (including the registry hostname/port, and the tag if needed).
    * If you want Kubernetes to pull the image from a private registry, create a Kubernetes secret to hold your credentials and set the `imagePullSecretName` property in the inputs file to the name of the secret.
{{% notice note %}}
The Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace where the domain will be running.
For more information, see [domain home in image protection]({{<relref "/security/domain-security/image-protection.md#weblogic-domain-in-docker-image-protection">}})
in the ***Security*** section.
{{% /notice %}}
    * Run the `create-domain.sh` script without the `-e` option.
    * Push the `image` to the registry.
    * Run the following command to create the domain.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f /some/output/directory/weblogic-domains/sample-domain1/domain.yaml
    ```

1.	Confirm that the operator started the servers for the domain:

    a. Use `kubectl` to show that the domain resource was created:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl describe domain sample-domain1 -n sample-domain1-ns
    ```

    b. After a short time, you will see the Administration Server and Managed Servers running.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns
    ```

    c. You should also see all the Kubernetes services for the domain.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get services -n sample-domain1-ns
    ```

1.	Create an Ingress for the domain, in the domain namespace, by using the [sample](http://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain/README.md) Helm chart:

    ```bash
    $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \
      --name sample-domain1-ingress \
      --namespace sample-domain1-ns \
      --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \
      --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org
    ```

1.	To confirm that the load balancer noticed the new Ingress and is successfully routing to the domain's server pods,
    you can send a request to the URL for the "WebLogic ReadyApp framework" which will return a HTTP 200 status code, as
    shown in the example below.  If you used the host-based routing Ingress sample, you will need to
    provide the hostname in the `-H` option.

    Substitute the Node IP address of the worker node for `your.server.com`. You can find it by running:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get po -n sample-domain1-ns -o wide
    ```
    ```
    $ curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://your.server.com:30305/weblogic/ready
      About to connect() to your.server.com port 30305 (#0)
        Trying 10.196.1.64...
        Connected to your.server.com (10.196.1.64) port 30305 (#0)
    > GET /weblogic/ HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
    > Accept: */*
    > host: domain1.org
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Length: 0
    < Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2018 14:52:22 GMT
    < Vary: Accept-Encoding
    <   Connection #0 to host your.server.com left intact
    ```
{{% notice note %}}
Depending on where your Kubernetes cluster is running, you may need to open firewall ports or update security lists to allow ingress to this port.

1.	To access the WLS Administration Console, edit the `my-inputs.yaml` file (assuming that you named your copy `my-inputs.yaml`) to set `exposedAdminNodePort: true`. Open a browser to `http://your.server.com:30701`. As in the previous step, substitute the Node IP address of the worker node for `your.server.com`.
