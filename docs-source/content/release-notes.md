The operator now supports the domain home on persistent volume or in Docker image use cases, which required a redesign of the domain schema.  You can override the domain configuration using configuration override templates.  Now load balancers and Ingresses can be independently configured.  You can direct WebLogic logs to a persistent volume or to the pod's log.  Added life cycle support for servers and significantly enhanced configurability for generated pods.
