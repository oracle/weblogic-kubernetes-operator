description: "Sample for creating a WebLogic domain home inside a Docker image, and the domain resource YAML file for deploying the generated WebLogic domain."
---

The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a WebLogic domain home in a Docker image using one of the domain home in image samples in the Oracle WebLogic Docker images [GitHub project](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic/samples). The sample scripts have the option of putting the WebLogic domain log, server logs, server output files, and the Node Manager logs on an existing Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used by the scripts or used manually to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain, including the WebLogic Server pods and services.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, read this document, [Domain resource]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource/_index.md" >}}).

The following prerequisites must be met prior to running the create domain script:

* The WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) sample requires that `JAVA_HOME` is set to a Java JDK version 1.8 or later.
* The operator requires either Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied, or Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0. The existing WebLogic Docker image, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3`, has all the necessary patches applied. For details on how to obtain or create the image, see [WebLogic Docker images]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md#creating-or-obtaining-weblogic-docker-images" >}}).
* Create a Kubernetes namespace for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace.
* If `logHomeOnPV` is enabled, create the Kubernetes persistent volume where the log home will be hosted, and the Kubernetes persistent volume claim for the domain in the same Kubernates namespace. For samples to create a PV and PVC, see [Create sample PV and PVC]({{< relref "/samples/simple/storage/_index.md" >}}).
* Create a Kubernetes secret for the WebLogic administrator credentials that contains the fields `username` and `password`, and make sure that the secret name matches the value specified for `weblogicCredentialsSecretName`; see [Configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters) below. For example:

```
$ cd ./kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials
$ create-weblogic-credentials.sh
   -u <username>
   -p <password>
   -d domain1
   -n default
   -s domain1-weblogic-credentials
```
**NOTE**: Using this example, you would configure `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` to be `domain1-weblogic-credentials`.

#### Use the script to create a domain

{{% notice note %}}
The `create-domain.sh` script generates a new Docker image on each run with a new domain home and a different internal `domain secret` in it.  To prevent having disparate images with different domain secrets in the same domain, we strongly recommend that a new domain uses a `domainUID` that is different from any of the active domains, or that you delete the existing domain resource using the following command and wait until all the server pods are terminated before you create a domain with the same `domainUID`:
`$ kubectl delete domain [domainUID] -n [domainNamespace]`
{{% /notice %}}

The sample for creating domains is in this directory:

```bash
$ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image
```

Make a copy of the `create-domain-inputs.yaml` file, update it with the correct values,
and run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory:

```
$ ./create-domain.sh \
  -u <username> \
  -p <password> \
  -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \
  -o /<path to output-directory>
```

The script will perform the following steps:

* Create a directory for the generated properties and Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist.  The pathname is `/<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>`. If the directory already exists, its contents will be removed.
* Create a properties file, `domain.properties`, in the directory that is created above. This properties file will be used to create a sample WebLogic Server domain.
* Clone the WebLogic docker-images project into the directory that is derived from the `domainHomeImageBuildPath` property using `git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git`. By default, the script always cleans up the directory and clones it again on every run. You need to specify the `-k` option if you want to use a previously cloned project. Note that if the specified `domainHomeImageBuildPath` is empty, the script will still clone the project even if the `-k` option is specified.
* Replace the built-in user name and password in the `properties/docker-build/domain_security.properties` file with the `username` and `password` that are supplied on the command line using the `-u` and `-p` options. These credentials need to match the WebLogic domain administrator credentials in the secret that is specified using the `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` property in the `create-domain-inputs.yaml` file.
* Build a Docker image based on the Docker sample, [Example Image with a WebLogic Server Domain using the Oracle WebLogic Scripting Tooling (WLST)](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image) or [Example Image with a WebLogic Server Domain using the Oracle WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT)](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt). It will create a sample WebLogic Server domain in the Docker image.
  {{% notice warning %}}
  Oracle strongly recommends storing the image containing the domain home as private
  in the registry (for example, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry, Docker Hub, and such) because
  this image contains sensitive information about the domain, including keys and
  credentials that are used to access external resources (for example, the data source password).
  For more information, see
  [WebLogic domain in Docker image protection]({{<relref "/security/domain-security/image-protection#weblogic-domain-in-docker-image-protection">}}).
  {{% /notice %}}
* Create a tag that refers to the generated Docker image.
* Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, `domain.yaml`, in the directory that is created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command.
```
$ kubectl apply -f /<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>/domain.yaml
```

As a convenience, using the `-e` option, the script can optionally create the domain object, which in turn results in the creation of the corresponding WebLogic Server pods and services. This option should be used in a single node Kubernetes cluster only.

For a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, make sure that the generated image is available on all nodes before creating the domain resource using the `kubectl apply -f` command.

The usage of the create script is as follows:

```
$ sh create-domain.sh -h
usage: create-domain.sh -o dir -i file -u username -p password [-k] [-e] [-h]
  -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified.
  -o Ouput directory for the generated properties and YAML files, must be specified.
  -u User name used in building the Docker image for WebLogic domain in image.
  -p Password used in building the Docker image for WebLogic domain in image.
  -e Also create the resources in the generated YAML files, optional.
  -v Validate the existence of persistentVolumeClaim, optional.
  -k Keep what has been previously cloned from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git, optional.
     If not specified, this script will always remove the existing project and clone again.
  -h Help

```

If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the `<weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project>/kubernetes/samples/scripts` directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.

The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:

* An Administration Server named `admin-server` listening on port `7001`.
* A dynamic cluster named `cluster-1` of size 5.
* Two Managed Servers, named `managed-server1` and `managed-server2`, listening on port `8001`.
* No applications deployed.
* A T3 channel.

If you run the sample from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster, and you need to push the new image to a registry that is local to the cluster, you need to do the following (also, see the `image` property in the [Configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters) table.):

* Set the `image` property in the inputs file to the target image name (including the registry hostname, port, and the tag, if needed).
* If you want Kubernetes to pull the image from a private registry, create a Kubernetes secret to hold your credentials and set the `imagePullSecretName` property in the inputs file to the name of the secret.
{{% notice note %}}
The Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace where the domain will be running.
For more information, see [WebLogic domain in Docker image protection]({{<relref "/security/domain-security/image-protection#weblogic-domain-in-docker-image-protection">}}).
{{% /notice %}}
* Run the `create-domain.sh` script without the `-e` option.
* Push the `image` to the target registry.
* Run the following command to create the domain:

```
$ kubectl apply -f /<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>/domain.yaml
```

The domain creation inputs can be customized by editing `create-domain-inputs.yaml`.

#### Configuration parameters
The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.

| Parameter | Definition | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sslEnabled` | Boolean indicating whether to enable SSL for each WebLogic Server instance. | `false` |
| `adminPort` | Port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. | `7001` |
| `adminServerSSLPort` | SSL port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. | `7002` |
| `adminNodePort` | Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `30701` |
| `adminServerName` | Name of the Administration Server. | `admin-server` |
| `clusterName` | Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. | `cluster-1` |
| `configuredManagedServerCount` | Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. | `5` |
| `domainHomeImageBase` | Base WebLogic binary image used to build the WebLogic domain image. The operator requires either Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied, or Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0. The existing WebLogic Docker image, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3`, has all the necessary patches applied. For details on how to obtain or create the image, see [WebLogic Docker images]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md#creating-or-obtaining-weblogic-docker-images" >}}). | `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3` |
| `domainHomeImageBuildPath` | Location of the WebLogic "domain home in image" Docker image in the `https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git` project. If not specified, use `./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image`. Another possible value is `./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt` which uses WDT, instead of WLST, to generate the domain configuration. | `./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image` |
| `domainPVMountPath` | Mount path of the domain persistent volume. This parameter is required if `logHomeOnPV` is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. | `/shared` |
| `domainUID` | Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. | `domain1` |
| `exposeAdminNodePort` | Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `exposeAdminT3Channel` | Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `httpAccessLogInLogHome` | Boolean indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as `logHome` if `logHomeOnPV` is true. Otherwise, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic domain home configuration. | `true` |
| `image` | WebLogic Server Docker image that the operator uses to start the domain. The create domain scripts generate a WebLogic Server Docker image with a domain home in it. By default, the scripts tag the generated WebLogic Server Docker image as either `domain-home-in-image` or `domain-home-in-image-wdt` based on the `domainHomeImageBuildPath` property, and use it plus the tag that is obtained from the `domainHomeImageBase` to set the `image` element in the generated domain YAML file. If this property is set, the create domain scripts will use the value specified, instead of the default value, to tag the generated image and set the `image` in the domain YAML file. A unique value is required for each domain that is created using the scripts. If you are running the sample scripts from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster where the domain is going to be running, you need to set this property to the image name that is intended to be used in a registry local to that Kubernetes cluster. You also need to push the `image` to that registry before starting the domain using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command. | |
| `imagePullPolicy` | WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are `IfNotPresent`, `Always`, or `Never`. | `IfNotPresent` |
| `imagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified. |  |
| `includeServerOutInPodLog` | Boolean indicating whether to include the server `.out` int the pod's stdout. | `true` |
| `initialManagedServerReplicas` | Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. | `2` |
| `javaOptions` | Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: `$(DOMAIN_NAME)`, `$(DOMAIN_HOME)`, `$(ADMIN_NAME)`, `$(ADMIN_PORT)`, and `$(SERVER_NAME)`. If `sslEnabled` is set to `true` and the WebLogic demo certificate is used, add `-Dweblogic.security.SSL.ignoreHostnameVerification=true` to allow the managed servers to connect to the Administration Server while booting up.  The WebLogic generated demo certificate in this environment typically contains a host name that is different from the runtime container's host name.  | `-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false` |
| `logHomeOnPV` | Specifies whether the log home is stored on the persistent volume. If set to true, then you must specify the `logHome`, `persistentVolumeClaimName`, and `domainPVMountPath` parameters.| `false` |
| `logHome` | The in-pod location for domain log, server logs, server out, Node Manager log, and server HTTP access log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`. This parameter is required if `logHomeOnPV` is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. | `/shared/logs/domain1` |
| `managedServerNameBase` | Base string used to generate Managed Server names. | `managed-server` |
| `managedServerPort` | Port number for each Managed Server. | `8001` |
| `managedServerSSLPort` | SSL port number for each Managed Server. | `8002` |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. | `default` |
| `persistentVolumeClaimName` | Name of the persistent volume claim. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `<domainUID>-weblogic-sample-pvc`. This parameter is required if `logHomeOnPV` is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. | `domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc` |
| `productionModeEnabled` | Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. | `true` |
| `serverStartPolicy` | Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are `NEVER`, `IF_NEEDED`, `ADMIN_ONLY`. | `IF_NEEDED` |
| `t3ChannelPort` | Port for the T3 channel of the network access point. | `30012` |
| `t3PublicAddress` | Public address for the T3 channel.  This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster.  This would typically be a load balancer address. <p/>For development environments only, in a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. |  If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster. |
| `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server user name and password. | `domain1-weblogic-credentials` |
| `serverPodCpuRequest`, `serverPodMemoryRequest`, `serverPodCpuCLimit`, `serverPodMemoryLimit` |  The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on `Managing Compute Resources for Containers` for details. | Resource requests and resource limits are not specified. |

Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the `create-inputs.yaml` file. Those properties include the `adminServerName`, `clusterName`, and `managedServerNameBase`. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore `("_")` is converted to a hyphen `("-")`.

The sample demonstrates how to create a WebLogic domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has only one cluster. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. Also, the generated domain YAML file can be modified to cover more use cases.

#### Verify the results

The create script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error.  However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

Note that the example results below use the `default` Kubernetes namespace. If you are using a different namespace, you need to replace `NAMESPACE` in the example `kubectl` commands with the actual Kubernetes namespace.

```

In the `Status` section of the output, the available servers and clusters are listed.  Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers.  The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready before starting the Managed Servers.

#### Verify the pods

Use the following command to see the pods running the servers:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
domain1-admin-server                         1/1       Running   0          30m
domain1-managed-server1                      1/1       Running   0          29m
domain1-managed-server2                      1/1       Running   0          29m
```

#### Verify the services

Use the following command to see the services for the domain:

```
$ kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:
