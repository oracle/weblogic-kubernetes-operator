### Introduction


This sample demonstrates deploying a Model in Image [domain home source type]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/_index.md" >}}). Unlike Domain in PV and Domain in Image, Model in Image eliminates the need to pre-create your WebLogic domain home prior to deploying your domain resource. Instead, Model in Image uses a WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model to specify your WebLogic configuration.

WDT models are a convenient and simple alternative to WebLogic WLST configuration scripts and templates. They compactly define a WebLogic domain using YAML files and support including application archives in a ZIP file. The WDT model format is described in the open source, [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) GitHub project, and the required directory structure for a WDT archive is specifically discussed [here](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/archive.md).

For more information on Model in Image, see the [Model in Image user guide]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}). For a comparison of Model in Image to other domain home source types, see [Choose a domain home source type]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/_index.md" >}}).

#### Model in Image domain types (WLS, JRF, and Restricted JRF)

There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, and a `RestrictedJRF` domain. This sample demonstrates the `WLS` and `JRF` types.

The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps required for JRF: deploying an infrastructure database, initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool, referencing the infrastructure database from the WebLogic configuration, setting an Oracle Platform Security Services (OPSS) wallet password, and exporting/importing an OPSS wallet file. `JRF` domains may be used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server, such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products, such as Oracle Communications products.

#### Use cases

This sample demonstrates two Model in Image use cases:

- [Initial](#initial-use-case): An initial WebLogic domain with the following characteristics:

   - Image `model-in-image:WLS-v1` with:
     - A WebLogic installation
     - A WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) installation
     - A WDT archive with version `v1` of an exploded Java EE web application
     - A WDT model with:
       - A WebLogic Administration Server
       - A WebLogic cluster
       - A reference to the web application
   - Kubernetes secrets:
     - WebLogic credentials
     - Required WDT runtime password
   - A domain resource with:
     - `spec.domainHomeSourceType: FromModel`
     - `spec.image: model-in-image:WLS-v1`
     - References to the secrets

- [Update1](#update1-use-case): Demonstrates udpating the initial domain by dynamically adding a data source using a model ConfigMap:

   - Image `model-in-image:WLS-v1`:
     - Same image as Initial use case
   - Kubernetes secrets:
     - Same as Initial use case  plus secrets for data source credentials and URL
   - Kubernetes ConfigMap with:
     - A WDT model for a data source targeted to the cluster
   - A domain resource with:
     - Same as Initial use case plus:
        - `spec.model.configMap` referencing the ConfigMap
        - References to data source secrets

#### Sample directory structure

The sample contains the following files and directories:

Location | Description |
------------- | ----------- |
`domain-resources` | JRF and WLS domain resources. |
`archives` | Source code location for WebLogic Deploy Tooling application ZIP archives. |
`model-images` | Staging for each model image's WDT YAML, WDT properties, and WDT archive ZIP files. The directories in `model images` are named for their respective images. |
`model-configmaps` | Staging files for a model ConfigMap that configures a data source. |
`ingresses` | Ingress resources. |
`utils/wl-pod-wait.sh` | Utility for watching the pods in a domain reach their expected `restartVersion`, image name, and ready state. |
`utils/patch-restart-version.sh` | Utility for updating a running domain `spec.restartVersion` field (which causes it to 're-instrospect' and 'roll'). |
`utils/opss-wallet.sh` | Utility for exporting or importing a JRF domain OPSS wallet file. |

### Prerequisites for all domain types

1. Choose the type of domain you're going to use throughout the sample, `WLS` or `JRF`.

   - The first time you try this sample, we recommend that you choose `WLS` even if you're familiar with `JRF`.
   - This is because `WLS` is simpler and will more easily familiarize you with Model in Image concepts.
   - We recommend choosing `JRF` only if you are already familiar with `JRF`, you have already tried the `WLS` path through this sample, and you have a definite use case where you need to use `JRF`.

1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 or 11 installation.

1. Get the operator source and put it in `/tmp/operator-source`.

   For example:

   ```
   $ mkdir /tmp/operator-source
   $ cd /tmp/operator-source
   $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git
   ```

   > **Note**: We will refer to the top directory of the operator source tree as `/tmp/operator-source`; however, you can use a different location.

   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).

1. Copy the sample to a new directory; for example, use directory `/tmp/mii-sample`.


   ```
   $ mkdir /tmp/mii-sample
   $ cp -r /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/* /tmp/mii-sample
   ```

   > **Note**: We will refer to this working copy of the sample as `/tmp/mii-sample`; however, you can use a different location.
   {{< rawhtml >}}
   <a name="resume"></a>
   {{< /rawhtml >}}
1. Make sure an operator is set up to manage namespace `sample-domain1-ns`. Also, make sure a Traefik Ingress controller is managing the same namespace and listening on port 30305.

   For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/) guide up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref "/quickstart/prepare.md" >}}) step.

   {{% notice info %}}
   Make sure you stop when you complete the "Prepare for a domain" step and then resume following these instructions.
   {{% /notice %}}

1. Set up Ingresses that will redirect HTTP from Traefik port 30305 to the clusters in this sample's WebLogic domains.

    - Option 1: To create the Ingresses, use the following YAML to create a file called `/tmp/mii-sample/ingresses/myingresses.yaml` and then call `kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/ingresses/myingresses.yaml`:

       ```
       apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
       kind: Ingress
       metadata:
         name: traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-admin-server
         namespace: sample-domain1-ns
         labels:
           weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain1
         annotations:
           kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
       spec:

               backend:
                 serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server
                 servicePort: 7001
       ---
       apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
       kind: Ingress
       metadata:
         name: traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1
         namespace: sample-domain1-ns
         labels:
           weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain1
         annotations:
           kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik

             - path:
               backend:
                 serviceName: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1
                 servicePort: 8001
       ---
       apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
       kind: Ingress
       metadata:
         name: traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-2
         namespace: sample-domain1-ns
         labels:
           weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain1
         annotations:
           kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
       spec:
         rules:
         - host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-2.mii-sample.org
           http:
             paths:
             - path:
               backend:
                 serviceName: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-2
                 servicePort: 8001
       ---
       apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
       kind: Ingress
       metadata:
         name: traefik-ingress-sample-domain2-cluster-cluster-1
         namespace: sample-domain1-ns
         labels:
           weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain2
         annotations:
           kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
       spec:
         rules:
         - host: sample-domain2-cluster-cluster-1.mii-sample.org
           http:
             paths:
             - path:
               backend:
                 serviceName: sample-domain2-cluster-cluster-1
                 servicePort: 8001
       ```

   - Option 2: Run `kubectl apply -f` on each of the Ingress YAML files that are already included in the sample source `/tmp/mii-sample/ingresses` directory:

   ```
   $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/ingresses
   $ kubectl apply -f traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-admin-server.yaml
   $ kubectl apply -f traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.yaml
   $ kubectl apply -f traefik-ingress-sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-2.yaml
   $ kubectl apply -f traefik-ingress-sample-domain2-cluster-cluster-1.yaml
   $ kubectl apply -f traefik-ingress-sample-domain2-cluster-cluster-2.yaml
   ```

   > **NOTE**: We give each cluster Ingress a different host name that is decorated using both its operator domain UID and its cluster name. This makes each cluster uniquely addressable even when cluster names are the same across different clusters.  When using `curl` to access the WebLogic domain through the Ingress, you will need to supply a host name header that matches the host names in the Ingress.

   For more on information Ingresses and load balancers, see [Ingress]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/ingress/_index.md" >}}).

1. Obtain the WebLogic 12.2.1.4 image that is required to create the sample's model images.

   a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).

   b. Choose an image location: for `JRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`; for `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.

   c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.

   d. Use your terminal to log in to Docker locally: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.

   e. Later in this sample, when you run WebLogic Image Tool commands, the tool will use the image as a base image for creating model images. Specifically, the tool will implicitly call `docker pull` for one of the above licensed images as specified in the tool's command line using the `--fromImage` parameter. For `JRF`, this sample specifies `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`, and for `WLS`, the sample specifies `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.

     {{% notice info %}}
   If you prefer, you can create your own base image and then substitute this image name in the WebLogic Image Tool `--fromImage` parameter throughout this sample. See [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md" >}}).
     {{% /notice %}}

1. Download the latest WebLogic Deploying Tooling and WebLogic Image Tool installer ZIP files to your `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images` directory.

   Both WDT and WIT are required to create your Model in Image Docker images. Download the latest version of each tool's installer ZIP file to the `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images` directory.

   For example, visit the GitHub [WebLogic Deploy Tooling Releses](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases) and [WebLogic Image Tool Releases](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases) web pages to determine the latest release version for each, and then, assuming the version numbers are `1.8.0` and `1.8.4` respectively, call:

   ```
   $ curl -m 30 -fL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/weblogic-deploy-tooling-1.8.0/weblogic-deploy.zip \
     -o /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip
   $ curl -m 30 -fL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-1.8.4/imagetool.zip \
     -o /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/imagetool.zip
   ```

1. Set up the WebLogic Image Tool.

   Run the following commands:

   ```
   $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images

   $ unzip imagetool.zip

   $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh cache addInstaller \
     --type wdt \
     --version latest \
     --path /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip
   ```

   These steps will install WIT to the `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/imagetool` directory, plus put a `wdt_latest` entry in the tool's cache which points to the WDT ZIP installer. We will use WIT later in the sample for creating model images.


### Additional prerequisites for JRF domains

> __NOTE__: If you're using a `WLS` domain type, skip this section and continue [here](#initial-use-case).

#### JRF Prerequisites Contents

 - [Introduction to JRF setups](#introduction-to-jrf-setups)
 - [Set up and initialize an infrastructure database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-infrastructure-database)
 - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)
 - [Important considerations for RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#important-considerations-for-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)

##### Introduction to JRF setups

> __NOTE__: The requirements in this section are in addition to [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).

A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database, initializing this database with RCU, and configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you create your domain.


##### Set up and initialize an infrastructure database

A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The database is set up with the following attributes:

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |
| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |
| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |
| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |
| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |
| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |
| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |


1. Ensure that you have access to the database image, and then create a deployment using it:

   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.

   - Get the database image:
     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.
     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.

   - Use the sample script in `/tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.

     ```
     $ cd /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service
     $ start-db-service.sh
     ```

     This script will deploy a database in the `default` namespace with the connect string `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password `Oradoc_db1`.

     This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).

     **WARNING:** The Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1).


2. Use the sample script in `/tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.

   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.

   ```
   $ cd /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema
   $ ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4
   ```

   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:

   ```
   $ drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1
   ```


##### Increase introspection job timeout

The JRF domain home creation can take more time than the introspection job's default timeout. You should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in your domain resource to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds). Note that the `JRF` versions of the domain resource files that are provided in `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources` already set this value.

##### Important considerations for RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets

To allow Model in Image to access the database and OPSS wallet, you must create an RCU access secret containing the database connect string, user name, and password that's referenced from your model and an OPSS wallet password secret that's referenced from your domain resource before deploying your domain.  It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model.

The sample includes examples of JRF models and domain resources in the `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images` and `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources` directories, and instructions in the following sections will describe setting up the RCU and OPSS secrets.

When you follow the instructions later in this sample, avoid instructions that are `WLS` only, and substitute `JRF` for `WLS` in the corresponding model image tags and domain resource file names.

For example:

  - JRF domain resources in this sample have an `opss.walletPasswordSecret` field that references a secret named `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`.

  - JRF image models in this sample have a `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza that reference a `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` for accessing the Oracle database that you deployed to the default namespace as one of the prerequisite steps.

##### Important considerations for reusing or sharing OPSS tables

{{% notice warning %}}
We do not recommend that most users share OPSS tables.  Extreme caution is required when sharing OPSS tables between domains.
{{% /notice %}}

When you successfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the OPSS tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes ConfigMap.

There are scenarios when the domain needs to be recreated between updates, such as when WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed, or you want to share the same infrastructure tables with different domains.  In these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be recreated and access the same set of tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to recreate a domain accessing the same set of  tables, therefore we strongly recommend that you back up the wallet file.

To recover a domain's OPSS tables between domain restarts or to share an OPSS schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the domain's automatically deployed introspector ConfigMap and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.

To save the wallet file, assuming that your namespace is `sample-domain1-ns` and your domain UID is `sample-domain1`:

```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns \
    get configmap sample-domain1-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm \
    -o jsonpath='{.data.ewallet\.p12}' \
    > ./ewallet.p12
```

Alternatively, you can save the file using the sample's wallet utility:

```
  $ /tmp/mii-sample/utils/opss-wallet.sh -n sample-domain1-ns -d sample-domain1 -wf ./ewallet.p12
  # For help: /tmp/mii-sample/utils/opss-wallet.sh -?
```

__Important! Back up your wallet file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.__

To reuse the wallet file in subsequent redeployments or to share the domain's OPSS tables between different domains:

1. Load the saved wallet file into a secret with a key named `walletFile` (again, assuming that your domain UID is `sample-domain1` and your namespace is `sample-domain1-ns`):

```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret \
     --from-file=walletFile=./ewallet.p12
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label secret sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret \
     weblogic.domainUID=`sample-domain1`
```

Alternatively, use the sample's wallet utility:
```
  $ /tmp/mii-sample/utils/opss-wallet.sh -n sample-domain1-ns -d sample-domain1 -wf ./ewallet.p12 -ws sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret
  # For help: /tmp/mii-sample/utils/opss-wallet.sh -?
```

2. Modify your domain resource JRF YAML files to provide the wallet file secret name, for example:

```
  configuration:
    opss:
      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet
      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      
      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet
      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret
```
> **Note**: The sample JRF domain resource files included in `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources` already have the above YAML stanza.

    - [Domain resource](#domain-resource)

#### Overview

In this use case, we set up an initial WebLogic domain. This involves:

  - A WDT archive ZIP file that contains your applications.
  - A WDT model that describes your WebLogic configuration.
  - A Docker image that contains your WDT model files and archive.
  - Creating secrets for the domain.
  - Creating a domain resource for the domain that references your secrets and image.

After the domain resource is deployed, the WebLogic operator will start an 'introspector job' that converts your models into a WebLogic configuration, and then the operator will pass this configuration to each WebLogic Server in the domain.

{{% notice note %}}
Perform the steps in [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) before performing the steps in this use case.  
If you are taking the `JRF` path through the sample, then substitute `JRF` for `WLS` in your image names and directory paths. Also note that the JRF-v1 model YAML differs from the WLS-v1 YAML file (it contains an additional `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza).
{{% /notice %}}

#### Image creation - Introduction

The goal of the initial use case 'image creation' is to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that we will stage to `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files will contain a web application in a WDT archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`.

Overall, a Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic installation and also a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation in its `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy` directory. In addition, if you have WDT model archive files, then the image must also contain these files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory. Finally, an image may optionally also contain your WDT model YAML and properties files in the same `/u01/wdt/models` directory. If you do not specify WDT model YAML in your `/u01/wdt/models` directory, then the model YAML must be supplied dynamically using a Kubernetes ConfigMap that is referenced by your domain resource `spec.model.configMap` attribute. We will provide an example of using a model ConfigMap later in this sample.

Let's walk through the steps for creating the image `model-in-image:WLS-v1`:

- [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive)
- [Staging a ZIP file of the archive](#staging-a-zip-file-of-the-archive)
- [Staging model files](#staging-model-files)
- [Creating the image with WIT](#creating-the-image-with-wit)

#### Understanding our first archive

The sample includes a predefined archive directory in `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` that we will use to create an archive ZIP file for the image.

The archive top directory, named `wlsdeploy`, contains a directory named `applications`, which includes an 'exploded' sample JSP web application in the directory, `myapp-v1`. Three useful aspects to remember about WDT archives are:
  - A model image can contain multiple WDT archives.
  - WDT archives can contain multiple applications, libraries, and other components.
  - WDT archives have a [well defined directory structure](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/archive.md), which always has `wlsdeploy` as the top directory.

The application displays important details about the WebLogic Server that it's running on: namely its domain name, cluster name, and server name, as well as the names of any data sources that are targeted to the server. You can also see that application output reports that it's at version `v1`; we will update this to `v2` in a future use case to demonstrate upgrading the application.

#### Staging a ZIP file of the archive

When we create our image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v1`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the WDT application archive.

Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:

```
# Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version
$ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip

# Move to the directory which contains the source files for our archive
$ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1

# Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool
$ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip wlsdeploy
```

#### Staging model files

In this step, we explore the staged WDT model YAML file and properties in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v1`. The model in this directory references the web application in our archive, configures a WebLogic Administration Server, and configures a WebLogic cluster. It consists of only two files, `model.10.properties`, a file with a single property, and, `model.10.yaml`, a YAML file with our WebLogic configuration `model.10.yaml`.

```
CLUSTER_SIZE=5
```

Here is the WLS `model.10.yaml`:

```

The model files:

- Define a WebLogic domain with:
  - Cluster `cluster-1`
  - Administration Server `admin-server`
  - A `cluster-1` targeted `ear` application that's located in the WDT archive ZIP file at `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`

- Leverage macros to inject external values:
  - The property file `CLUSTER_SIZE` property is referenced in the model YAML `DynamicClusterSize` and `MaxDynamicClusterSize` fields using a PROP macro.
  - The model file domain name is injected using a custom environment variable named `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` using an ENV macro.
    - We set this environment variable later in this sample using an `env` field in its domain resource.
    - _This conveniently provides a simple way to deploy multiple differently named domains using the same model image._
  - The model file administrator user name and password are set using a `weblogic-credentials` secret macro reference to the WebLogic credential secret.
    - This secret is in turn referenced using the `weblogicCredentialsSecret` field in the domain resource.
    - The `weblogic-credentials` is a reserved name that always dereferences to the owning domain resource actual WebLogic credentials secret name.

A Model in Image image can contain multiple properties files, archive ZIP files, and YAML files, but in this sample we use just one of each. For a full discussion of Model in Images model file naming conventions, file loading order, and macro syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user documentation.


#### Creating the image with WIT

> **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.

At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v1`, they include:

  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.yaml`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.properties`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip`

If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.

Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.

Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:

  ```
  $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images
  $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \
    --tag model-in-image:WLS-v1 \
    --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \
    --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.yaml \
    --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.properties \
    --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip \
    --wdtModelOnly \
    --wdtDomainType WLS
  ```

If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.

This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:

  - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.
  - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.
    - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.
    - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.
  - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.

When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:

  ```
  [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v1
  ```

Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.

#### Deploy resources - Introduction

In this section we will deploy our new image to namespace `sample-domain1-ns`, including the following steps:

  - Create a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.
  - Create a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:
    - All Model in Image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.
    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the operator.
    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary; you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.
  - If your domain type is `JRF`, create secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix.
  - Deploy a domain resource YAML file that references the new image.
  - Wait for the domain's pods to start and reach their ready state.

#### Secrets

First, create the secrets needed by both `WLS` and `JRF` type model domains. In this case, we have two secrets.

Run the following `kubectl` commands to deploy the required secrets:

  ```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials \
     --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1

  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-runtime-encryption-secret \
     --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-runtime-encryption-secret \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
  ```

  Some important details about these secrets:

  - The WebLogic credentials secret:
    - It is required and must contain `username` and `password` fields.
    - It must be referenced by the `spec.weblogicCredentialsSecret` field in your domain resource.
    - It also must be referenced by macros in the `domainInfo.AdminUserName` and `domainInfo.AdminPassWord` fields in your model YAML file.

  - The Model WDT runtime secret:
    - This is a special secret required by Model in Image.
    - It must contain a `password` field.
    - It must be referenced using the `spec.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret` attribute in its domain resource.
    - It must remain the same for as long as the domain is deployed to Kubernetes, but can be changed between deployments.
    - It is used to encrypt data as it's internally passed using log files from the domain's introspector job and on to its WebLogic Server pods.

  - Deleting and recreating the secrets:
    - We delete a secret before creating it, otherwise the create command will fail if the secret already exists.
    - This allows us to change the secret when using the `kubectl create secret` command.

  - We name and label secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:
    - To make it obvious which secrets belong to which domains.
    - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.


  If you're following the `JRF` path through the sample, then you also need to deploy the additional secret referenced by macros in the `JRF` model `RCUDbInfo` clause, plus an `OPSS` wallet password secret. For details about the uses of these secrets, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}) user documentation.

  {{%expand "Click here for the commands for deploying additional secrets for JRF." %}}

  ```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-rcu-access \
     --from-literal=rcu_prefix=FMW1 \
     --from-literal=rcu_schema_password=Oradoc_db1 \
     --from-literal=rcu_db_conn_string=oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-rcu-access \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1

  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret \
     --from-literal=walletPassword=welcome1
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
  ```

#### Domain resource

Now let's create a domain resource. A domain resource is the key resource that tells the operator how to deploy a WebLogic domain.

Copy the following to a file called `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-initial.yaml` or similar, or use the file `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-initial-d1-WLS-v1.yaml` that is included in the sample source.

  Run the following command to create the domain custom resource:

  ```
  $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-initial-d1-WLS-v1.yaml
  ```

  > Note: If you are choosing not to use the predefined domain resource YAML file and instead created your own domain resource file earlier, then substitute your custom file name in the above command. You might recall that we suggested naming it `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-initial.yaml`.

  If you run `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch`, then you should see the introspector job run and your WebLogic Server pods start. The output should look something like this:

Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.

  {{%expand "Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage." %}}
  ```
  $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?

    Usage:

         [-p expected_pod_count] \
         [-t timeout_secs] \
         [-q]

      Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.

    Parameters:

      -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.

      -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.

      pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for

#### Invoke the web application

Now that all the initial use case resources have been deployed, you can invoke the sample web application through the Traefik Ingress controller's NodePort. Note: The web application will display a list of any data sources it finds, but we don't expect it to find any because the model doesn't contain any at this point.

Send a web application request to the load balancer:

   ```
   $ curl -s -S -m 10 -H 'host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.mii-sample.org' \
      http://localhost:30305/myapp_war/index.jsp
   ```
Or, if Traefik is unavailable and your Administration Server pod is running, you can use `kubectl exec`:

   ```
   $ kubectl exec -n sample-domain1-ns sample-domain1-admin-server -- bash -c \
     "curl -s -S -m 10 http://sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1:8001/myapp_war/index.jsp"
   ```

You should see output like the following:

  ```
  $ curl -s -S -m 10 -H 'host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.mii-sample.org' \
    http://localhost:30305/myapp_war/index.jsp

  <html><body><pre>
  *****************************************************************

  Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.

  Welcome to WebLogic server 'managed-server2'!

   domain UID  = 'sample-domain1'
   domain name = 'domain1'

  Found 1 local cluster runtime:

  *****************************************************************
  </pre></body></html>
  ```

  **Note**: If you're running your `curl` commands on a remote machine, then substitute `localhost` with an external address suitable for contacting your Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster address that often works can be obtained by using the address just after `https://` in the KubeDNS line of the output from the `kubectl cluster-info` command.

 If you want to continue to the next use case, then leave your domain running.

### Update1 use case

This use case demonstrates dynamically adding a data source to your running domain. It demonstrates several features of WDT and Model in Image:

- The syntax used for updating a model is exactly the same syntax you use for creating the original model.
- A domain's model can be updated dynamically by supplying a model update in a file in a Kubernetes ConfigMap.
- Model updates can be as simple as changing the value of a single attribute, or more complex, such as adding a JMS Server.

For a detailed discussion of model updates, see [Runtime Updates]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.

{{% notice warning %}}
The operator does not support all possible dynamic model updates. For model update limitations, consult [Runtime Updates]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user docs, and carefully test any model update before attempting a dynamic update in production.
{{% /notice %}}

Here are the steps:

1. Ensure that you have a running domain.

    Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case).

1. Create a data source model YAML file.

    Create a WDT model snippet for a data source (or use the example provided).  Make sure that its target is set to `cluster-1`, and that its initial capacity is set to `0`.

   The reason for the latter is to prevent the data source from causing a WebLogic Server startup failure if it can't find the database, which would be likely to happen because we haven't deployed one (unless you're using the `JRF` path through the sample).

   Here's an example data source model configuration that meets these criteria:


   ```
   resources:
     JDBCSystemResource:
       mynewdatasource:
         Target: 'cluster-1'
         JdbcResource:
           JDBCDataSourceParams:
             JNDIName: [
               jdbc/mydatasource1,
               jdbc/mydatasource2
             ]
             GlobalTransactionsProtocol: TwoPhaseCommit
           JDBCDriverParams:
             DriverName: oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource
             URL: '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-datasource-secret:url@@'
             PasswordEncrypted: '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-datasource-secret:password@@'
             Properties:
               user:
                 Value: 'sys as sysdba'
               oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT:
                 Value: 5000
               oracle.jdbc.ReadTimeout:
                 Value: 30000
           JDBCConnectionPoolParams:
               InitialCapacity: 0
               MaxCapacity: 1
               TestTableName: SQL ISVALID
               TestConnectionsOnReserve: true

   ```

   Place the above model snippet in a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` and then use it in the later step where we deploy the model ConfigMap, or alternatively, use the same data source that's provided in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource/model.20.datasource.yaml`.

1. Create the data source secret.

   The data source references a new secret that needs to be created. Run the following commands to create the secret:

   ```
   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
     sample-domain1-datasource-secret \
      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \
      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s
   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
     sample-domain1-datasource-secret \
     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
   ```

    We name and label secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:
     - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domains.
     - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all the resources associated with a domain.


1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.

   Run the following commands:


   ```
   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain1-wdt-config-map \
     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource
   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain1-wdt-config-map \
     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
   ```

     - If you've created your own data source file, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier).
     - Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.

   We name and label ConfigMap using their associated domain UID for two reasons:
     - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belong to which domains.
     - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.

1. Update your domain resource to refer to the ConfigMap and secret.

    - Option 1: Update your current domain resource file from the "Initial" use case.
      - Add the secret to its `spec.configuration.secrets` stanza:

          ```
          spec:
            ...
            configuration:
            ...
              secrets:
              - sample-domain1-datasource-secret
          ```
         (Leave any existing secrets in place.)

      - Change its `spec.configuration.model.configMap` to look like:

          ```
          spec:
            ...
            configuration:
              ...
              model:
                ...
                configMap: sample-domain1-wdt-config-map
           ```
      - Apply your changed domain resource:

          ```
          $ kubectl apply -f your-domain-resource.yaml
          ```

    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:

        ```
        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml
        ```


1. Restart ('roll') the domain.

   Now that the data source is deployed in a ConfigMap and its secret is also deployed, and we have applied an updated domain resource with its `spec.configuration.model.configMap` and `spec.configuration.secrets` referencing the ConfigMap and secret, let's tell the operator to roll the domain.

   When a model domain restarts, it will rerun its introspector job in order to regenerate its configuration, and it will also pass the configuration changes found by the introspector to each restarted server.
   One way to cause a running domain to restart is to change the domain's `spec.restartVersion`. To do this:

   - Option 1: Edit your domain custom resource.
     - Call `kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns edit domain sample-domain1`.
     - Edit the value of the `spec.restartVersion` field and save.
       - The field is a string; typically, you use a number in this field and increment it with each restart.

   - Option 2: Dynamically change your domain using `kubectl patch`.
     - To get the current `restartVersion` call:
       ```
       $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get domain sample-domain1 '-o=jsonpath={.spec.restartVersion}'
       ```
     - Choose a new restart version that's different from the current restart version.
       - The field is a string; typically, you use a number in this field and increment it with each restart.

     - Use `kubectl patch` to set the new value. For example, assuming the new restart version is `2`:
       ```
       $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns patch domain sample-domain1 --type=json '-p=[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/restartVersion", "value": "2" }]'
       ```
   - Option 3: Use the sample helper script.
     - Call `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/patch-restart-version.sh -n sample-domain1-ns -d sample-domain1`.
     - This will perform the same `kubectl get` and `kubectl patch` commands as Option 2.


1. Wait for the roll to complete.

    Now that you've started a domain roll, you'll need to wait for it to complete if you want to verify that the data source was deployed.

   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.

   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.

     {{%expand "Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage." %}}
   ```
     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?

       Usage:

         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \
            [-p expected_pod_count] \
            [-t timeout_secs] \
            [-q]

         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.

       Parameters:

         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.

         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.

         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for
                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same
                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the
                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and
                           (c) have the same image as the current domain
                           resource's image.

         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods
                           for a domain. The default.

         -t <timeout>    : Timeout in seconds. Defaults to '600'.

         -q              : Quiet mode. Show only a count of wl pods that
                           have reached the desired criteria.

         -?              : This help.

1. After your domain is running, you can call the sample web application to determine if the data source was deployed.

   Send a web application request to the Ingress controller:

   ```  
   $ curl -s -S -m 10 -H 'host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.mii-sample.org' \
      http://localhost:30305/myapp_war/index.jsp
   ```  

   Or, if Traefik is unavailable and your Administration Server pod is running, you can run `kubectl exec`:

   ```  
   $ kubectl exec -n sample-domain1-ns sample-domain1-admin-server -- bash -c \
     "curl -s -S -m 10 http://sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1:8001/myapp_war/index.jsp"
   ```  

   You should see something like the following:

   Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.

   Welcome to WebLogic server 'managed-server1'!

    domain UID  = 'sample-domain1'
    domain name = 'domain1'

   Found 1 local cluster runtime:
     Cluster 'cluster-1'

   Found 1 local data source:
     Datasource 'mynewdatasource': State='Running'

If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.

This completes the sample scenarios.


### Cleanup

To remove the resources you have created in these samples:

1. Delete the domain resources.
   ```
   $ /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/delete-domain/delete-weblogic-domain-resources.sh -d sample-domain1
   $ /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/delete-domain/delete-weblogic-domain-resources.sh -d sample-domain2
   ```

   This deletes the domain and any related resources that are labeled with the domain UID `sample-domain1` and `sample-domain2`.

   It leaves the namespace intact, the operator running, the load balancer running (if installed), and the database running (if installed).

   > **Note**: When you delete a domain, the operator should detect your domain deletion and shut down its pods. Wait for these pods to exit before deleting the operator that monitors the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace. You can monitor this process using the command `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` (`ctrl-c` to exit).

2. If you set up the Traefik Ingress controller:

   ```
   $ helm delete --purge traefik-operator
   $ kubectl delete namespace traefik
   ```

3. If you set up a database for `JRF`:
   ```
   $ /tmp/operator-source/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service/stop-db-service.sh
   ```

4. Delete the operator and its namespace:
   ```
   $ helm delete --purge sample-weblogic-operator
   $ kubectl delete namespace sample-weblogic-operator-ns
   ```

6. Delete the domain's namespace:
   ```
   $ kubectl delete namespace sample-domain1-ns
   ```

7. Delete the images you may have created in this sample:
   ```
   $ docker image rm model-in-image:WLS-v1
   $ docker image rm model-in-image:WLS-v2
   $ docker image rm model-in-image:JRF-v1
   $ docker image rm model-in-image:JRF-v2
   ```
