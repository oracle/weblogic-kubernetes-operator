#### Overview

In this use case, you set up an initial WebLogic domain. This involves:

  - A WDT archive ZIP file that contains your applications.
  - A WDT model that describes your WebLogic configuration.
  - A Docker image that contains your WDT model files and archive.
  - Creating secrets for the domain.
  - Creating a domain resource for the domain that references your secrets and image.

After the domain resource is deployed, the operator starts an 'introspector job' that converts your models into a WebLogic configuration, and then passes this configuration to each WebLogic Server in the domain.

{{% notice note %}}
Perform the steps in [Prerequisites for all domain types]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/prerequisites.md" >}}) before performing the steps in this use case.  
If you are taking the `JRF` path through the sample, then substitute `JRF` for `WLS` in your image names and directory paths. Also note that the JRF-v1 model YAML file differs from the WLS-v1 YAML file (it contains an additional `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza).
{{% /notice %}}

#### Image creation - Introduction

The goal of the initial use case 'image creation' is to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that you will stage to `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files will contain a web application in a WDT archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`.

Overall, a Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation in its `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy` directory. In addition, if you have WDT model archive files, then the image must also contain these files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory. Finally, an image optionally may also contain your WDT model YAML file and properties files in the same `/u01/wdt/models` directory. If you do not specify a WDT model YAML file in your `/u01/wdt/models` directory, then the model YAML file must be supplied dynamically using a Kubernetes ConfigMap that is referenced by your domain resource `spec.model.configMap` attribute. We provide an example of using a model ConfigMap later in this sample.

Here are the steps for creating the image `model-in-image:WLS-v1`:

- [Understanding your first archive](#understanding-your-first-archive)
- [Staging a ZIP file of the archive](#staging-a-zip-file-of-the-archive)
- [Staging model files](#staging-model-files)
- [Creating the image with WIT](#creating-the-image-with-wit)

#### Understanding your first archive

The sample includes a predefined archive directory in `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` that you will use to create an archive ZIP file for the image.

The archive top directory, named `wlsdeploy`, contains a directory named `applications`, which includes an 'exploded' sample JSP web application in the directory, `myapp-v1`. Three useful aspects to remember about WDT archives are:
  - A model image can contain multiple WDT archives.
  - WDT archives can contain multiple applications, libraries, and other components.
  - WDT archives have a [well defined directory structure](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/archive.md), which always has `wlsdeploy` as the top directory.

The application displays important details about the WebLogic Server instance that it's running on: namely its domain name, cluster name, and server name, as well as the names of any data sources that are targeted to the server. Also, you can see that application output reports that it's at version `v1`; you will update this to `v2` in a later use case that demonstrates upgrading the application.

#### Staging a ZIP file of the archive

When you create the image, you will use the files in the staging directory, `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v1`. In preparation, you need it to contain a ZIP file of the WDT application archive.

Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:

```
# Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version
$ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip

# Move to the directory which contains the source files for our archive
$ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1

# Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool
$ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip wlsdeploy
```

#### Staging model files

In this step, you explore the staged WDT model YAML file and properties in the `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v1` directory. The model in this directory references the web application in your archive, configures a WebLogic Server Administration Server, and configures a WebLogic cluster. It consists of only two files, `model.10.properties`, a file with a single property, and, `model.10.yaml`, a YAML file with your WebLogic configuration `model.10.yaml`.

```
CLUSTER_SIZE=5
```

Here is the WLS `model.10.yaml`:

```

    AdminUserName: '@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:username@@'

The model files:

- Define a WebLogic domain with:
  - Cluster `cluster-1`
  - Administration Server `admin-server`
  - A `cluster-1` targeted `ear` application that's located in the WDT archive ZIP file at `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`

- Leverage macros to inject external values:
  - The property file `CLUSTER_SIZE` property is referenced in the model YAML file `DynamicClusterSize` and `MaxDynamicClusterSize` fields using a PROP macro.
  - The model file domain name is injected using a custom environment variable named `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` using an ENV macro.
    - You set this environment variable later in this sample using an `env` field in its domain resource.
    - _This conveniently provides a simple way to deploy multiple differently named domains using the same model image._
  - The model file administrator user name and password are set using a `weblogic-credentials` secret macro reference to the WebLogic credential secret.
    - This secret is in turn referenced using the `webLogicCredentialsSecret` field in the domain resource.
    - The `weblogic-credentials` is a reserved name that always dereferences to the owning domain resource actual WebLogic credentials secret name.

A Model in Image image can contain multiple properties files, archive ZIP files, and YAML files but in this sample you use just one of each. For a complete discussion of Model in Images model file naming conventions, file loading order, and macro syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user documentation.


#### Creating the image with WIT

> **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.

At this point, you have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v1`; they include:

  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.yaml`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.properties`
  - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip`

If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then you missed a step in the [prerequisites]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/prerequisites.md" >}}).

Now, you use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. You've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps.

Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:

  ```
  $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images
  $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \
    --tag model-in-image:WLS-v1 \
    --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \
    --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.yaml \
    --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.properties \
    --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v1/archive.zip \
    --wdtModelOnly \
    --wdtDomainType WLS
  ```

If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then you missed a step in the [prerequisites]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/prerequisites.md" >}}).

This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:

  - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.
  - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.
    - Note that you cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when you set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.
    - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.
  - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.

When the command succeeds, it should end with output like the following:

  ```
  [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v1
  ```

Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you will see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.

> Note: If you have Kubernetes cluster worker nodes that are remote to your local machine, then you need to put the image in a location that these nodes can access. See [Ensuring your Kubernetes cluster can access images](#ensuring-your-kubernetes-cluster-can-access-images).

#### Deploy resources - Introduction

In this section, you will deploy the new image to namespace `sample-domain1-ns`, including the following steps:

  - Create a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.
  - Create a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:
    - All Model in Image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.
    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the operator.
    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary; you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.
  - If your domain type is `JRF`, create secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix.
  - Deploy a domain resource YAML file that references the new image.
  - Wait for the domain's pods to start and reach their ready state.

#### Secrets

First, create the secrets needed by both `WLS` and `JRF` type model domains. In this case, you have two secrets.

Run the following `kubectl` commands to deploy the required secrets:

  ```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials \
     --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1

  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-runtime-encryption-secret \
     --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-runtime-encryption-secret \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
  ```

  Some important details about these secrets:

  - The WebLogic credentials secret:
    - It is required and must contain `username` and `password` fields.
    - It must be referenced by the `spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret` field in your domain resource.
    - It also must be referenced by macros in the `domainInfo.AdminUserName` and `domainInfo.AdminPassWord` fields in your model YAML file.

  - The Model WDT runtime secret:
    - This is a special secret required by Model in Image.
    - It must contain a `password` field.
    - It must be referenced using the `spec.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret` attribute in its domain resource.
    - It must remain the same for as long as the domain is deployed to Kubernetes but can be changed between deployments.
    - It is used to encrypt data as it's internally passed using log files from the domain's introspector job and on to its WebLogic Server pods.

  - Deleting and recreating the secrets:
    - You delete a secret before creating it, otherwise the create command will fail if the secret already exists.
    - This allows you to change the secret when using the `kubectl create secret` command.

  - You name and label secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:
    - To make it obvious which secrets belong to which domains.
    - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.


  If you're following the `JRF` path through the sample, then you also need to deploy the additional secret referenced by macros in the `JRF` model `RCUDbInfo` clause, plus an `OPSS` wallet password secret. For details about the uses of these secrets, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}) user documentation.

  {{%expand "Click here for the commands for deploying additional secrets for JRF." %}}

  ```
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-rcu-access \
     --from-literal=rcu_prefix=FMW1 \
     --from-literal=rcu_schema_password=Oradoc_db1 \
     --from-literal=rcu_db_conn_string=oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-rcu-access \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1

  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \
    sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret \
     --from-literal=walletPassword=welcome1
  $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \
    sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret \
    weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain1
  ```

#### Domain resource

Now, you create a domain resource. A domain resource is the key resource that tells the operator how to deploy a WebLogic domain.

Copy the following to a file called `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-initial.yaml` or similar, or use the file `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-initial-d1-WLS-v1.yaml` that is included in the sample source.

  > **Note**: Before you deploy the domain custom resource, determine if you have Kubernetes cluster worker nodes that are remote to your local machine. If so, you need to put the domain resource's image in a location that these nodes can access and you may also need to modify your domain resource file to reference the new location. See [Ensuring your Kubernetes cluster can access images]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md#ensuring-your-kubernetes-cluster-can-access-images" >}}).

  Run the following command to create the domain custom resource:

  ```
  $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-initial-d1-WLS-v1.yaml
  ```

  > Note: If you are choosing _not_ to use the predefined domain resource YAML file and instead created your own domain resource file earlier, then substitute your custom file name in the above command. Previously, we suggested naming it `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-initial.yaml`.

  If you run `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch`, then you will see the introspector job run and your WebLogic Server pods start. The output will look something like this:

  ```

Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.

  {{%expand "Click here to display the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage." %}}
  ```
  $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?

    Usage:

      wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \
         [-p expected_pod_count] \
         [-t timeout_secs] \
         [-q]

      Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.

    Parameters:

      -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.

      -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.

      pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic Server pods for
                        a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same
                        'domainRestartVersion' label value as the
                        current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and
                        (c) have the same image as the current domain
                        resource's image.

      pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic Server pods
                        for a domain. The default.

      -t <timeout>    : Timeout in seconds. Defaults to '1000'.

      -q              : Quiet mode. Show only a count of wl pods that
                        have reached the desired criteria.

If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.

#### Invoke the web application

Now that all the initial use case resources have been deployed, you can invoke the sample web application through the Traefik ingress controller's NodePort.

**Note**: The web application will display a list of any data sources it finds, but at this point, we don't expect it to find any because the model doesn't contain any.

Send a web application request to the load balancer:

   ```
   $ curl -s -S -m 10 -H 'host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.mii-sample.org' \
      http://localhost:30305/myapp_war/index.jsp
   ```
Or, if Traefik is unavailable and your Administration Server pod is running, you can use `kubectl exec`:

   ```
   $ kubectl exec -n sample-domain1-ns sample-domain1-admin-server -- bash -c \
     "curl -s -S -m 10 http://sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1:8001/myapp_war/index.jsp"
   ```

You will see output like the following:

   ```
   <html><body><pre>
   *****************************************************************

   Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.

   Welcome to WebLogic Server 'managed-server2'!

    domain UID  = 'sample-domain1'
    domain name = 'domain1'

   Found 1 local cluster runtime:
     Cluster 'cluster-1'

   Found 0 local data sources:

   *****************************************************************
   </pre></body></html>
   ```

 **Note**: If you're running your `curl` commands on a remote machine, then substitute `localhost` with an external address suitable for contacting your Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster address that often works can be obtained by using the address just after `https://` in the KubeDNS line of the output from the `kubectl cluster-info` command.

 If you want to continue to the [Update 1]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/update1.md" >}}) use case, then leave your domain running.

 To remove the resources you have created in this sample, see [Cleanup]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/cleanup.md" >}}).
