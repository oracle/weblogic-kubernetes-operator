description: "Sample for creating a SOA Suite domain home on an existing PV or
PVC, and the domain resource YAML file for deploying the generated SOA domain."
---

{{% notice warning %}}
Oracle SOA Suite is currently supported only for non-production use in Docker and Kubernetes.  The information provided
in this document is a *preview* for early adopters who wish to experiment with Oracle SOA Suite in Kubernetes before
it is supported for production use.
{{% /notice %}}

The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a SOA Suite domain home on an
existing Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). The scripts
also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes
artifacts of the corresponding domain.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, perform the following steps:

* Review the [Domain resource]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource/_index.md" >}}) documentation.
* Review the [system requirements]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/soa-suite#prerequisites-for-soa-suite-domains" >}}) for deploying Oracle SOA Suite domains on Kubernetes.
* Make sure that Kubernetes is set up in the environment. For details, see the [Kubernetes setup guide]({{< relref "/userguide/overview/k8s-setup.md" >}}).
* Make sure that the WebLogic Kubernetes operator is running. See [Manage operators]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md" >}}) for operator infrastructure setup and [Install the operator]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-operators/installation/_index.md" >}}) for operator installation. Make sure you install the operator version 2.4.0.
* Create a Kubernetes Namespace (for example, `soans`) for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace. Use the newly created namespace in all the other steps.
For details, see [Prepare to run a domain]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/prepare.md" >}}).

  ```
   $ kubectl create namespace soans
  ```

* In the Kubernetes Namespace created above, create the PV and PVC for the database
by running the [create-pv-pvc.sh]({{< relref "/samples/simple/storage/_index.md" >}}) script.
Follow the instructions for using the scripts to create a PV and PVC.

    * Change the values in the [create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc/create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml) file based on your requirements.

    * Ensure that the path mentioned for the `weblogicDomainStoragePath` property does exists (if not, you need to create it), has read and write access permissions, and it must be an empty directory.

* Create the Kubernetes Secrets `username` and `password` of the administrative account in the same Kubernetes
  namespace as the domain. For details, see this [document](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials/README.md).

    ```bash
    $ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials
    $ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p Welcome1 -n soans -d soainfra -s soainfra-domain-credentials
    ```

    You can check the secret with the `kubectl get secret` command. See the following example, including the output:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get secret soainfra-domain-credentials -o yaml -n soans
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      password: V2VsY29tZTE=
      username: d2VibG9naWM=
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: 2019-06-02T07:05:25Z
      labels:
        weblogic.domainName: soainfra
        weblogic.domainUID: soainfra
      name: soainfra-domain-credentials
      namespace: soans
      resourceVersion: "11561988"
      selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-domain-credentials
      uid: a91ef4e1-6ca8-11e9-8143-fa163efa261a
    type: Opaque
    ```
* Complete the other preliminary required steps documented [here]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/soa-suite/_index.md" >}}).

#### Prepare to use the create domain script

The sample scripts for Oracle SOA Suite domain deployment are available at `<weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project>/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain`.

You must edit `create-domain-inputs.yaml` (or a copy of it) to provide the details for your domain.
Please refer to the configuration parameters below to understand the information that you must
provide in this file.

#### Configuration parameters
The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.

| Parameter | Definition | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adminPort` | Port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. | `7001` |
| `adminNodePort` | Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `30701` |
| `adminServerName` | Name of the Administration Server. | `AdminServer` |
| `clusterName` | Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. By default the cluster name is `soa_cluster` for the SOA domain. You can update this to `osb_cluster` for an OSB domain type or `soa_cluster` for SOAESS or SOAOSB or SOAESSOSB domain types.| `soa_cluster` |
| `configuredManagedServerCount` | Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. | `5` |
| `createDomainFilesDir` | Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the `createDomainScriptName` property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path `wlst`, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the `wlst` directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path `wdt`, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes ConfigMap, which in turn is mounted to the `createDomainScriptsMountPath`, so that the Kubernetes Pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. | `wlst` |
| `createDomainScriptsMountPath` | Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The `create-domain.sh` script creates a Kubernetes Job to run the script (specified in the `createDomainScriptName` property) in a Kubernetes Pod to create a domain home. Files in the `createDomainFilesDir` directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes Pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. | `/u01/weblogic` |
| `createDomainScriptName` | Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The `create-domain.sh` script creates a Kubernetes Job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the `createDomainScriptsMountPath` property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. | `create-domain-job.sh` |
| `domainHome` | Home directory of the SOA domain. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `/shared/domains/<domainUID>`. | `/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/soainfra` |
| `domainPVMountPath` | Mount path of the domain persistent volume. | `/u01/oracle/user_projects` |
| `domainUID` | Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes Service name. | `soainfra` |
| `domainType` | Type of the domain. Mandatory input for SOA Suite domains. You must provide one of the supported domain type values: `soa` (deploys a SOA domain),`osb` (deploys an OSB (Oracle Service Bus) domain),`soaess` (deploys a SOA domain with Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)),`soaosb` (deploys a domain with SOA and OSB), and `soaessosb` (deploys a domain with SOA, OSB, and ESS). | `soa`
| `exposeAdminNodePort` | Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `exposeAdminT3Channel` | Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `httpAccessLogInLogHome` | Boolean indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as `logHome`. Otherwise, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic domain home configuration. | `true` |
| `image` | SOA Suite Docker image. The operator requires SOA Suite 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied. Refer to [SOA domains]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/soa-suite/_index.md#obtaining-the-soa-suite-docker-image" >}}) for details on how to obtain or create the image. | `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3` |
| `imagePullPolicy` | WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are `IfNotPresent`, `Always`, or `Never` | `IfNotPresent` |
| `imagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes Secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified. |  |
| `includeServerOutInPodLog` | Boolean indicating whether to include the server `.out` in the pod's `stdout`. | `true` |
| `initialManagedServerReplicas` | Number of Managed Servers to start initially for the domain. | `2` |
| `javaOptions` | Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: `$(DOMAIN_NAME)`, `$(DOMAIN_HOME)`, `$(ADMIN_NAME)`, `$(ADMIN_PORT)`, and `$(SERVER_NAME)`. | `-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false` |
| `logHome` | The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, Node Manager log, and server HTTP access log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`. | `/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/logs/soainfra` |
| `managedServerNameBase` | Base string used to generate Managed Server names. | `soa_server` |
| `managedServerPort` | Port number for each Managed Server. | `8001` |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes Namespace in which to create the domain. | `soans` |
| `persistentVolumeClaimName` | Name of the persistent volume claim created to host the domain home. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `<domainUID>-weblogic-sample-pvc`. | `soainfra-domain-pvc` |
| `productionModeEnabled` | Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. | `true` |
| `serverStartPolicy` | Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are `NEVER`, `IF_NEEDED`, `ADMIN_ONLY`. | `IF_NEEDED` |
| `t3ChannelPort` | Port for the T3 channel of the network access point. | `30012` |
| `t3PublicAddress` | Public address for the T3 channel.  This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster.  This would typically be a load balancer address. <p/>For development environments only, in a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes Deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. | If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster. |
| `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes Secret for the Administration Server user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `<domainUID>-weblogic-credentials`. | `soainfra-domain-credentials` |
| `weblogicImagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes Secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image. |   |
| `serverPodCpuRequest`, `serverPodMemoryRequest`, `serverPodCpuCLimit`, `serverPodMemoryLimit` |  The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on `Managing Compute Resources for Containers` for details. | Resource requests and resource limits are not specified. |
| `rcuSchemaPrefix` | The schema prefix to use in the database, for example `SOA1`.  You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. | `SOA1` |
| `rcuDatabaseURL` | The database URL. | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |
| `rcuCredentialsSecret` | The Kubernetes Secret containing the database credentials. | `soainfra-rcu-credentials` |

Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the
value of some of the properties specified in the `create-inputs.yaml` file. Those properties include
the `adminServerName`, `clusterName` and `managedServerNameBase`. If those values contain any
characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes Service name, those characters are converted to
valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a
lowercase letter and an underscore `("_")` is converted to a hyphen `("-")`.

The sample demonstrates how to create a SOA Suite domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain
that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts
to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.

#### Run the create domain script

Run the create domain script, specifying your inputs file and an output directory to store the
generated artifacts:

```
$ ./create-domain.sh \
  -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \
  -o /<path to output-directory>
```

The script will perform the following steps:

* Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not
  already exist.  The path name is `/<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>`.
  If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script.
* Create a Kubernetes Job that will start up a utility SOA Suite container and run
  offline WLST scripts to create the domain on the shared storage.
* Run and wait for the job to finish.
* Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, `domain.yaml`, in the "output" directory that was created above.
  This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the `kubectl create -f`
  or `kubectl apply -f` command:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f /<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>/domain.yaml
    ```

* Create a convenient utility script, `delete-domain-job.yaml`, to clean up the domain home
  created by the create script.



The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:

* An Administration Server named `AdminServer` listening on port `7001`.
* A configured cluster named `soa_cluster-1` of size 5.
* Two Managed Servers, named `soa_server1` and `soa_server2`, listening on port `8001`.
* Log files that are located in `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`.
* SOA Infra, SOA composer and WorklistApp applications deployed.
* No data sources or JMS resources.
* A T3 channel.

#### Verify the results

The create domain script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error.
However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the
various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

Note that the example results below use the `default` Kubernetes Namespace. If you are using a different
namespace, you need to replace `NAMESPACE` in the example `kubectl` commands with the actual Kubernetes Namespace.

```

In the `Status` section of the output, the available servers and clusters are listed.
Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be
no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers.
The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready
before starting the Managed Servers.

#### Verify the pods

Use the following command to see the pods running the servers:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command. You can verify that an Administration Server and two Managed Servers for each cluster (SOA and OSB) are running for `soaessosb` domain type.

```
$ kubectl get pods -n soans

#### Verify the services

Use the following command to see the services for the domain:

```
$ kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command. You can verify that services for Administration Server and Managed Servers (for SOA and OSB clusters) are created for `soaessosb` domain type.

```
$ kubectl get services -n soans

#### Delete the generated domain home

Sometimes in production, but most likely in testing environments, you might want to remove the domain
home that is generated using the `create-domain.sh` script. Do this by running the generated
`delete domain job` script in the `/<path to weblogic-operator-output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>` directory.

```
$ kubectl create -f delete-domain-job.yaml

```
