Oracle strongly recommends storing a domain image as private in the registry.
A Docker image that contains a WebLogic domain home has sensitive information
including keys and credentials that are used to access external resources
(for example, the data source password). For more information, see
[WebLogic domain in Docker image protection]({{<relref "/security/domain-security/image-protection#weblogic-domain-in-docker-image-protection">}}).
