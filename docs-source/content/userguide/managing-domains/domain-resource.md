#### Overview

Use this document to create your own Domain resource, which can be used to configure the operation of your WebLogic Server domain. The Domain resource does not replace the traditional domain configuration files, but instead cooperates with those files to describe the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain.  For instance, the domain configuration will still specify deployed applications, data sources, and most other details about the domain while the Domain resource will specify the number of cluster members currently running or the persistent volumes that will be mounted into the containers running WebLogic Server instances.

{{% notice tip %}}
Many of the samples accompanying the operator project include scripts to generate an initial Domain resource from a set of simplified inputs; however, the Domain resource is the actual source of truth for how the operator will manage each WebLogic Server domain. You are encouraged to either start with the Domain resource YAML files generated by the various samples or create Domain resources manually or by using other tools based on the schema referenced here or this documentation.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled before proceeding with the creation of a domain resource:

* Create a Kubernetes Namespace for the Domain unless the intention is to use the default namespace.
* Make sure the WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator is running and is configured to monitor the namespace.
* Make sure any resources that the domain resource references are deployed to the same namespace. For example, all domain resources have a `spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret` field that references a Kubernetes Secret containing the `username` and `password` of the WebLogic server administrative account.
* Make sure a domain resource configuration and its corresponding WebLogic configuration [meet Kubernetes resource name restrictions]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/_index.md#meet-kubernetes-resource-name-restrictions" >}}).

For example, see the [Quick Start]({{< relref "/quickstart/_index.md" >}}).

#### Deploying domain resource YAML files

Domains are defined using YAML files. For each WebLogic Server domain you want to run, you should create one Domain resource YAML file and apply it. In the example referenced below, the sample scripts generate a Domain resource YAML file that you can use as a basis. Copy the file and override the default settings so that it matches all the WebLogic Server domain parameters that define your domain.

See the WebLogic Server samples, [Domain home on a PV]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/domain-home-on-pv/_index.md" >}}),
[Domain home in Image]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/domain-home-in-image/_index.md" >}}), and [Model in Image]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}).

After you have written your YAML files, you use them to create your domain artifacts using the `kubectl apply -f` command.

```none
$ kubectl apply -f domain-resource.yaml
```

To confirm that the Domain was created, use this command:

```none
$ kubectl get domains -n [namespace]
```

To view all of the attributes of a running domain, including the domain's status, use this command:

```none
$ kubectl describe domain [domain name] -n [namespace]
```

Or this command:

```none
$ kubectl get domain [domain name] -n [namespace] -o yaml
```

#### Domain resource custom resource definition (CRD)

The Domain type is defined by a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) and, like all [Kubernetes objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/), is described by three sections: `metadata`, `spec`, and `status`.

The operator installs the CRD for the Domain type when the operator first starts. Customers may also choose to install the CRD in advance by using one of the provided YAML files. Installing the CRD in advance allows you to run the operator without giving it privilege (through Kubernetes roles and bindings) to access or update the CRD or other cluster-scoped resources. This may be necessary in environments where the operator cannot have cluster-scoped privileges, such as OpenShift Dedicated. The operator's role based access control (RBAC) requirements are documented [here]({{< relref "/security/rbac.md" >}}).

For Kubernetes 1.16 and later:

```none
$ kubectl create -f kubernetes/crd/domain-crd.yaml
```

For Kubernetes 1.15 and earlier:

```none
$ kubectl create -f kubernetes/crd/domain-v1beta1-crd.yaml
```

After the CustomResourceDefinition is installed, either by the operator or using one of the `create` commands above, you can verify that the CRD is installed correctly using:

```none
$ kubectl get crd domains.weblogic.oracle
```

#### Domain resource attribute references

The domain resource `metadata` section names the Domain and its namespace.  The name of the Domain is the default value for the `domain UID` which is used by the operator to distinguish domains running in the Kubernetes cluster that may have the same domain name. The Domain name must be unique in the namespace and the domain UID should be unique across the cluster.  The domain UID, Domain resource name, and domain name (from the WebLogic domain configuration) may all be different.

The domain resource `spec` section describes the intended running state of the domain, including intended runtime state of WebLogic Server instances, number of cluster members started, and details about Kubernetes Pod or Service generation, such as resource constraints, scheduling requirements, or volume mounts.

The operator automatically updates the `status` section of a deploy domain resource to describe the actual running state of the domain, including WebLogic Server instance runtime states and current health.

Here are some references you can use for the fields in these sections:

- See [Domain spec elements](#domain-spec-elements) in this doc.
- See [Domain resource](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md).
- Swagger documentation is available [here](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/swagger/index.html).
- Use [kubectl explain](#leveraging--kubectl-explain-) from the command line.

#### Using `kubectl explain`

If you are using Kubernetes 1.16 or later, you can access the description of any field of the Domain using `kubectl explain`. For instance, the following command displays the description of the `domainUID` field:

```none
$ kubectl explain domain.spec.domainUID
KIND:     Domain
VERSION:  weblogic.oracle/v8

FIELD:    domainUID <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     Domain unique identifier. It is recommended that this value be unique to
     assist in future work to identify related domains in active-passive
     scenarios across data centers; however, it is only required that this value
     be unique within the namespace, similarly to the names of Kubernetes
     resources. This value is distinct and need not match the domain name from
     the WebLogic domain configuration. Defaults to the value of
     `metadata.name`.
```

#### Domain spec elements

The Domain `spec` section contains elements for configuring the domain operation and sub-sections specific to the Administration Server, specific clusters, or specific Managed Servers.

Elements related to domain identification, container image, and domain home:

* `domainUID`: Domain unique identifier. This identifier is required to be no more than 45 characters, and practically, should be shorter in order to help ensure Kubernetes restrictions are met (for more details, see [Meet Kubernetes resource name restrictions]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/_index.md#meet-kubernetes-resource-name-restrictions" >}})). It is recommended that this value be unique to assist in future work to identify related domains in active-passive scenarios across data centers; however, it is only required that this value be unique within the namespace, similarly to the names of Kubernetes resources. This value is distinct and need not match the domain name from the WebLogic domain configuration. Defaults to the value of `metadata.name`. 
* `image`: The WebLogic container image; required when `domainHomeSourceType` is Image or FromModel; otherwise, defaults to container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4.
* `imagePullPolicy`: The image pull policy for the WebLogic container image. Legal values are Always, Never, and IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if image ends in :latest; IfNotPresent, otherwise.
* `imagePullSecrets`: A list of image pull Secrets for the WebLogic container image.
* `domainHome`: The directory containing the WebLogic domain configuration inside the container. Defaults to /shared/domains/domains/<domainUID> if `domainHomeSourceType` is PersistentVolume. Defaults to /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/ if `domainHomeSourceType` is Image. Defaults to /u01/domains/<domainUID> if `domainHomeSourceType` is FromModel.
* `domainHomeSourceType`: Domain home file system source type: Legal values: Image, PersistentVolume, FromModel. Image indicates that the domain home file system is present in the container image specified by the `image` field. PersistentVolume indicates that the domain home file system is located on a persistent volume. FromModel indicates that the domain home file system will be created and managed by the operator based on a WDT domain model. If this field is specified, it overrides the value of `domainHomeInImage`. If both fields are unspecified, then `domainHomeSourceType` defaults to Image.
* `dataHome`: An optional directory in a server's container for data storage of default and custom file stores. If `dataHome` is not specified or its value is either not set or empty, then the data storage directories are determined from the WebLogic domain configuration.

Elements related to logging:

* `includeServerOutInPodLog`: Specifies whether the server .out file will be included in the Pod's log. Defaults to true.
* `logHome`: The directory in a server's container in which to store the domain, Node Manager, server logs, server *.out, introspector .out, and optionally HTTP access log files if `httpAccessLogInLogHome` is true. Ignored if `logHomeEnabled` is false.
* `logHomeEnabled`: Specifies whether the log home folder is enabled. Defaults to true if `domainHomeSourceType` is PersistentVolume; false, otherwise.
* `httpAccessLogInLogHome`: Specifies whether the server HTTP access log files will be written to the same directory specified in `logHome`. Otherwise, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory configured in the WebLogic domain configuration. Defaults to true.

Elements related to security:

* `webLogicCredentialsSecret`: Reference to a Kubernetes Secret that contains the user name and password needed to boot a WebLogic Server under the `username` and `password` fields.
* See also elements under `configuration` below.

Elements related to domain [startup and shutdown]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup.md" >}}):

* `serverStartPolicy`: The strategy for [deciding whether to start]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup#starting-and-stopping-servers" >}}) a WebLogic Server instance. Legal values are ADMIN_ONLY, NEVER, or IF_NEEDED. Defaults to IF_NEEDED.
* `serverStartState`: The WebLogic runtime state in which the server is to be started. Use ADMIN if the server should start in the admin state. Defaults to RUNNING.
* `restartVersion`: Changes to this field cause the [operator to restart]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup#restarting-servers" >}}) WebLogic Server instances.
* `replicas`: The default number of cluster member Managed Server instances to start for each WebLogic cluster in the domain configuration, unless `replicas` is specified for that cluster under the `clusters` field. For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come after "managed-server9". The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Servers will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas` count. Defaults to 0.
* `maxClusterConcurrentStartup`: The maximum number of cluster member Managed Server instances that the operator will start in parallel for a given cluster, if `maxConcurrentStartup` is not specified for a specific cluster under the `clusters` field. A value of 0 means there is no configured limit. Defaults to 0.
* `allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize`: Whether to allow the number of running cluster member Managed Server instances to drop below the minimum dynamic cluster size configured in the WebLogic domain configuration, if this is not specified for a specific cluster under the `clusters` field. Defaults to true.
* `introspectVersion`: Changes to this field cause the operator to repeat its introspection of the WebLogic domain configuration (see [Initiating introspection]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/introspection/_index.md#initiating-introspection" >}})). Repeating introspection is required for the operator to recognize changes to the domain configuration, such as adding a new WebLogic cluster or Managed Server instance, to regenerate configuration overrides, or to regenerate the WebLogic domain home when the `domainHomeSourceType` is FromModel. Introspection occurs automatically, without requiring change to this field, when servers are first started or restarted after a full domain shut down. For the FromModel `domainHomeSourceType`, introspection also occurs when a running server must be restarted because of changes to any of the fields [listed here]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup#fields-that-cause-servers-to-be-restarted" >}}). See also `overrideDistributionStrategy`.

Elements related to specifying and overriding WebLogic domain configuration:

* These elements are under `configuration`.

  * `overridesConfigMap`: The name of the ConfigMap for WebLogic [configuration overrides]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md" >}}). If this field is specified, then the value of `spec.configOverrides` is ignored.
  * `overrideDistributionStrategy`: Determines how updated configuration overrides are distributed to already running WebLogic Server instances following introspection when the `domainHomeSourceType` is PersistentVolume or Image. Configuration overrides are generated during introspection from Secrets, the `overridesConfigMap` field, and WebLogic domain topology. Legal values are DYNAMIC, which means that the operator will distribute updated configuration overrides dynamically to running servers, and ON_RESTART, which means that servers will use updated configuration overrides only after the server's next restart. The selection of ON_RESTART will not cause servers to restart when there are updated configuration overrides available. See also `introspectVersion`. Defaults to DYNAMIC.
  * `secrets`: A list of names of the Secrets for WebLogic [configuration overrides]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md" >}}) or model. If this field is specified, then the value of `spec.configOverrideSecrets` is ignored.
  * `introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds`: The introspector job timeout value in seconds. If this field is specified, then the operator's ConfigMap `data.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` value is ignored. Defaults to 120 seconds.

* These elements are under `configuration.model`, only apply if the `domainHomeSourceType` is `FromModel`, and are discussed in [Model in Image]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}).

  * `configMap`: (Optional) Name of a ConfigMap containing WebLogic Deploy Tooling model YAML files or `.properties` files.
  * `domainType`: WebLogic Deploy Tooling domain type. Legal values: WLS, RestrictedJRF, JRF. Defaults to WLS.
  * `runtimeEncryptionSecret`: The name of the Secret containing the runtime encryption password, which must be in a field named `password`. Required when `domainHomeSourceType` is set to `FromModel`.
  * `modelHome`: Location of the WebLogic Deploy Tooling model home directory, which can include model YAML files, `.properties` variable files, and application `.zip` archives. Defaults to `/u01/wdt/models`.

* These elements are under `configuration.opss`, and only apply if the `domainHomeSourceType` is `FromModel` and the `domainType` is `JRF`.

  * `walletPasswordSecret`: Name of a Secret containing the OPSS key passphrase, which must be in a field named `walletPassword`. Used to encrypt and decrypt the wallet that is used for accessing the domain's entries in its RCU database.
  * `walletFileSecret`: Name of a Secret containing the OPSS key wallet file, which must be in a field named `walletFile`. Use this to allow a JRF domain to reuse its entries in the RCU database. This allows you to specify a wallet file that was obtained from the domain home after the domain was booted for the first time.

* These elements are under `configuration.istio`.

  * `enabled`: True, if this domain is deployed under an Istio service mesh. Defaults to true when the `istio` field is specified.
  * `readinessPort`: The operator will create a WebLogic network access point with this port that will then be exposed from the container running the WebLogic Server instance. The readiness probe will use this network access point to verify that the server instance is ready for application traffic. Defaults to 8888.

Elements related to Kubernetes Pod and Service generation:

* `serverPod`: Customization affecting the generation of Pods for WebLogic Server instances.
* `serverService`: Customization affecting the generation of Kubernetes Services for WebLogic Server instances.

Sub-sections related to the Administration Server, specific clusters, or specific Managed Servers:

* `adminServer`: Lifecycle options for the Administration Server, including Java options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and which channels or network access points should be exposed using a NodePort Service.
* `clusters`: Lifecycle options for all of the Managed Server members of a WebLogic cluster, including Java options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and the ability to explicitly start, stop, or restart cluster members. The `clusterName` field of each entry must match a cluster that already exists in the WebLogic domain configuration.
* `managedServers`: Lifecycle options for individual Managed Servers, including Java options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and the ability to explicitly start, stop, or restart a named server instance. The `serverName` field of each entry must match a Managed Server that already exists in the WebLogic domain configuration or that matches a dynamic cluster member based on the server template.

The elements `serverStartPolicy`, `serverStartState`, `serverPod` and `serverService` are repeated under `adminServer` and under each entry of `clusters` or `managedServers`.  The values directly under `spec`, set the defaults for the entire domain.  The values under a specific entry under `clusters`, set the defaults for cluster members of that cluster.  The values under `adminServer` or an entry under `managedServers`, set the values for that specific server.  Values from the domain scope and values from the cluster (for cluster members) are merged with or overridden by the setting for the specific server depending on the element.  See [Startup and shutdown]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup.md" >}}) for details about `serverStartPolicy` combinations.

Elements related to the customization of liveness and readiness probes:
* See [Liveness probe customization]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/liveness-readiness-probe-customization#liveness-probe-customization" >}}) for details about the elements related to liveness probe customization and [Readiness probe customization]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/liveness-readiness-probe-customization#readiness-probe-customization" >}}) for details about the elements related to readiness probe customization.

### JVM memory and Java option environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to specify JVM memory and JVM option arguments to WebLogic Server Managed Server and Node Manager instances:

* `JAVA_OPTIONS`: Java options for starting WebLogic Server.
* `USER_MEM_ARGS`: JVM memory arguments for starting WebLogic Server.
* `NODEMGR_JAVA_OPTIONS`: Java options for starting a Node Manager instance.
* `NODEMGR_MEM_ARGS`: JVM memory arguments for starting a Node Manager instance.
* `WLST_PROPERTIES`: System properties for WLST commands in introspector jobs or WebLogic Server instance containers.
* `WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES`: System properties for WebLogic Deploy Tool commands during Model in Image introspector jobs or WebLogic Server instance containers.
* `PRE_CLASSPATH`: Path(s) that are *prepended* to the WebLogic Server system classpath; delimit multiple paths with a colon `:`.
* `CLASSPATH`: Path(s) that are *appended* to the WebLogic Server system classpath; delimit multiple paths with a colon `:`.

**Notes:**

* The following behavior occurs depending on whether or not `NODEMGR_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `NODEMGR_MEM_ARGS` are defined:
  * If `NODEMGR_JAVA_OPTIONS` is not defined and `JAVA_OPTIONS` is defined, then the `JAVA_OPTIONS` value will be applied to the Node Manager instance.
  * If `NODEMGR_MEM_ARGS` is not defined, then default memory and Java security property values (`-Xms64m -Xmx100m -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom`) will be applied to the Node Manager instance. It can be explicitly set to another value in your Domain YAML file using the `env` attribute under the `serverPod` configuration.
* The `USER_MEM_ARGS` environment variable defaults to `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom` in all WebLogic Server pods and the WebLogic introspection job. It can be explicitly set to another value in your Domain YAML file using the `env` attribute under the `serverPod` configuration.
* Notice that the `NODEMGR_MEM_ARGS` and `USER_MEM_ARGS` environment variables both set `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom` by default. This respectively helps to speed up the Node Manager and WebLogic Server startup on systems with low entropy.
* For a detailed discussion of Java and pod memory tuning see the [Pod memory and CPU resources FAQ]({{<relref "/faq/resource-settings.md">}}).
* You can use `JAVA_OPTIONS` and `WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES` to disable Fast Application Notifications (FAN); see the [Disable Fast Application Notifications FAQ]({{<relref "/faq/fan.md">}}) for details.

This example snippet illustrates how to add some of the above environment variables using the `env` attribute under the `serverPod` configuration in your Domain YAML file.

    - name: CLASSPATH
      value: "/sample/path/appended/to/weblogic/system/classpath:/another/appended/path"
```

#### Pod generation

The operator creates a Pod for each running WebLogic Server instance.  This Pod will have a container, named `weblogic-server`, based on the container image specified by the `image` field.  Additional Pod or container content can be specified using the elements under `serverPod`. This includes Kubernetes sidecar and init containers, labels, annotations, volumes, volume mounts, scheduling constraints, including anti-affinity, [resource requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/), or [security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

Customer provided labels and annotations may not begin with "weblogic" and the operator will generate the following labels:

* `weblogic.createdByOperator: "true"`
* `weblogic.domainName: <domain-name>`, where `<domain-name>` is the name of the WebLogic domain
* `weblogic.domainUID: <uid>`, where `<uid>` is the domain UID from the Domain resource
* `weblogic.serverName: <server-name>`, where `<server-name>` is the name of the WebLogic Server instance
* `weblogic.clusterName: <cluster-name>`, where `<cluster-name>` is the name of the cluster of which this instance is a member, if any

Prior to creating a Pod, the operator replaces variable references allowing the Pod content to be templates.  The format of these variable references is `$(VARIABLE_NAME)` where `VARIABLE_NAME` is one of the variable names available in the container for the WebLogic Server instance. The default set of environment variables includes:

* `DOMAIN_NAME`: The WebLogic Server domain name.
* `DOMAIN_UID`: The domain unique identifier.
* `DOMAIN_HOME`: The domain home location as a file system path within the container.
* `SERVER_NAME`: The WebLogic Server instance name.
* `CLUSTER_NAME`: The WebLogic cluster name, if this is a cluster member.
* `LOG_HOME`: The WebLogic log location as a file system path within the container.

This example domain YAML file specifies that Pods for WebLogic Server instances in the `cluster-1` cluster will have a per-Managed Server volume and volume mount (similar to a Kubernetes StatefulSet), an init container to initialize some files in that volume, and anti-affinity scheduling so that the server instances are scheduled, as much as possible, on different Nodes:

        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /init-volume
          name: $(SERVER_NAME)-volume
    replicas: 2
```

The operator uses an "introspection" job to discover details about the WebLogic domain configuration, such as the list of clusters and network access points.  The Job Pod for the introspector is generated using the `serverPod` entries for the Administration Server.  Because the Administration Server name is not known until the introspection step is complete, the value of the `$(SERVER_NAME)` variable for the introspection job will be "introspector".
