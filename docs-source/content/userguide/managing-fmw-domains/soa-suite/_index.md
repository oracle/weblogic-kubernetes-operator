#### Introduction

The operator supports deployment of SOA Suite components such as Oracle Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Oracle Service Bus (OSB), and Oracle Enterprise Scheduler (ESS). Currently the operator supports these different domain types:

* `soa`: Deploys a SOA domain
* `osb`: Deploys an OSB (Oracle Service Bus) domain
* `soaess`: Deploys a SOA domain with Enterprise Scheduler (ESS)
* `soaosb`: Deploys a domain with SOA and OSB
* `soaessosb`: Deploys a domain with SOA, OSB, and ESS

This document provides details about the special considerations for deploying and running SOA Suite domains with the operator.
Other than those considerations listed here, SOA Suite domains work in the same way as FMW Infrastructure domains and WebLogic Server domains.

In this release, SOA Suite domains are supported using the “domain on a persistent volume”
[model]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/_index.md" >}}) only, where the domain home is located in a persistent volume (PV).

#### Prerequisites for SOA Suite domains

* Kubernetes 1.13.5+, 1.14.3+ and 1.15.2+ (check with `kubectl version`).
* Flannel networking v0.11.0-amd64 (check with `docker images | grep flannel`).
* Docker 18.9.1 (check with `docker version`)
* Helm 2.14.0+ (check with `helm version`).
* Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12.2.1.3.0 image with patch 29135930.
  * The existing Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Docker image, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3`, has all the necessary patches applied.
  * Check the Fusion Middleware Infrastructure patches with `docker run container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3 sh -c '$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches'`.    
* You must have the `cluster-admin` role to install the operator.
* We do not currently support running SOA in non-Linux containers.

#### Limitations

Compared to running a WebLogic Server domain in Kubernetes using the operator, the
following limitations currently exist for SOA Suite domains:

* The "domain in image" model is not supported.
* Only configured clusters are supported.  Dynamic clusters are not supported for
  SOA Suite domains.  Note that you can still use all of the scaling features,
  you just need to define the maximum size of your cluster at domain creation time.
* Deploying and running SOA Suite domains is supported only in operator versions 2.4.0 and later.
* The [WebLogic Logging Exporter](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-logging-exporter)
  currently supports WebLogic Server logs only.  Other logs will not be sent to
  Elasticsearch.  Note, however, that you can use a sidecar with a log handling tool
  like Logstash or fluentd to get logs.
* The [WebLogic Monitoring Exporter](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-monitoring-exporter)
  currently supports the WebLogic MBean trees only.  Support for JRF MBeans has not
  been added yet.

{{% notice note %}}
For early access customers, with bundle patch access, we recommend that you build and use the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image with the latest bundle patch for Oracle SOA. The Oracle SOA Suite Docker image in `container-registry.oracle.com` does not have the bundle patch installed. However, if you do not have access to the bundle patch, you can obtain the Oracle SOA Suite Docker image without the bundle patch from `container-registry.oracle.com`, as described below.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Obtaining the SOA Suite Docker Image

The pre-built Oracle SOA Suite image is available at, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3`.

To pull an image from the Oracle Container Registry, in a web browser, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in
using the Oracle Single Sign-On authentication service. If you do not already have SSO credentials, at the top of the page, click the Sign In link to create them.

Use the web interface to accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions for the Oracle software images that you intend to deploy.
Your acceptance of these terms are stored in a database that links the software images to your Oracle Single Sign-On login credentials.

To obtain the image, log in to the Oracle Container Registry:

```
$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com
```

Then, you can pull the image with this command:

```
$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3
```

#### Creating a SOA Suite Docker image

You can also create a Docker image containing the Oracle SOA Suite binaries. This is the recommended approach if you have access to the Oracle SOA bundle patch.

Please consult the [README](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles/README.md) file for important prerequisite steps,
such as building or pulling the Server JRE Docker image, Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker image, and downloading the Oracle SOA Suite installer and bundle patch binaries.

For the Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, you must install the [required patch]({{< relref "/userguide/introduction/introduction/_index.md#prerequisites" >}}) to use this image with the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes operator. A pre-built (and already patched) Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3-200109`, is available at `container-registry.oracle.com`. We recommend that you pull and rename this image to build the Oracle SOA Suite image.


  ```bash
    $ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3-200109
    $ docker tag container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3-200109  oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3
  ```

{{% notice warning %}}
If you are pulling the Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image from `container-registry.oracle.com`, you must use the image with the tag `12.2.1.3-200109`; no other tagged image will work for the Oracle SOA Suite image build.
{{% /notice %}}

You can also build the Fusion Middleware
Infrastructure image with the required patch (29135930) applied. A [sample](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleFMWInfrastructure/samples/12213-patch-fmw-for-k8s) is provided that demonstrates how to create a Docker image with the necessary patch installed. Use this patched Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image for building the Oracle SOA Suite image.

Follow these steps to build the necessary images - a patched Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, and then the SOA Suite image as a layer on top of that:

* Make a local clone of the sample repository.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images
    ```
* Build the `oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3` image as shown below:

  ```bash
    $ cd docker-images/OracleFMWInfrastructure/dockerfiles
    $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.3 -s
  ```
* Download the required patch (29135930) from My Oracle Support.
* Create a Docker image containing the Fusion Middleware Infrastructure binaries with the patch applied by running the provided script:

    ```bash
    $ cd docker-images/OracleFMWInfrastructure/samples/12213-patch-fmw-for-k8s
    $ ./build.sh
    ```
    This will produce an image named `oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12213-update-k8s`. You will need to rename this image, for example from `oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12213-update-k8s`
    to `oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3`, or update the samples to refer to the image you created.

    ```
    $ docker tag oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12213-update-k8s oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.3
    ```
* Download the Oracle SOA Suite installer, latest Oracle SOA bundle patch (`30638100` or later) and the patch `27117282` from the Oracle Technology Network or e-delivery.

  >**NOTE**: Copy the installer binaries to the same location as the Dockerfile and the patch ZIP files under the `docker-images/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles/12.2.1.3/patches` folder.

* Create the Oracle SOA Suite image by running the provided script:

    ```bash
    $ cd docker-images/OracleSOASuite/dockerfiles
    $ ./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.3 -s
    ```

    The image produced will be named `oracle/soa:12.2.1.3`. The samples and
    instructions assume the Oracle SOA Suite image is named
    `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3`.
    You will need to rename your image to match this name,
     or update the samples to refer to the image you created.

    ```bash
    $ docker tag oracle/soa:12.2.1.3 container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3
    ```

    You can use this image to run the Repository Creation Utility and to run your domain using the “domain on a persistent volume” model.

Before creating a domain, you will need to set up the necessary schemas in your database.

#### Configuring access to your database

SOA Suite domains require a database with the necessary schemas installed in them.
The Repository Creation Utility (RCU) allows you to create
those schemas.  You must set up the database before you create your domain.
There are no additional requirements added by running SOA in Kubernetes; the
same existing requirements apply.

For testing and development, you may choose to run your database inside Kubernetes or outside of Kubernetes.

{{% notice warning %}}
The Oracle Database Docker images are supported for non-production use only.
For more details, see My Oracle Support note:
Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1).
{{% /notice %}}

##### Running the database inside Kubernetes

Follow these instructions to perform a basic deployment of the Oracle
database in Kubernetes. For more details about database setup and configuration, refer to this [page]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/fmw-infra/_index.md#running-the-database-inside-kubernetes" >}}).

When running the Oracle database in Kubernetes, you have an option to attach persistent volumes (PV) so that the database storage will be persisted across database restarts. If you prefer not to persist the database storage, follow the instructions in this
[document](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/tree/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema#start-an-oracle-database-service-in-a-kubernetes-cluster) to set up a database in a container with no persistent volume (PV) attached.

>**NOTE**: `start-db-service.sh` creates the database in the `default` namespace. If you
>want to create the database in a different namespace, you need to manually update
>the value for all the occurrences of the namespace field in the provided
>sample file `create-rcu-schema/common/oracle.db.yaml`.

These instructions will set up the database in a container with the persistent volume (PV) attached.
If you chose not to use persistent storage, please go to the [RCU creation step](#running-the-repository-creation-utility-to-set-up-your-database-schemas).

* Create the persistent volume and persistent volume claim for the database
using the [create-pv-pvc.sh]({{< relref "/samples/simple/storage/_index.md" >}}) sample.
Refer to the instructions provided in that sample.

{{% notice note %}}
When creating the PV and PVC for the database, make sure that you use a different name
and storage class for the PV and PVC for the domain.
The name is set using the value of the `baseName` field in `create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml`.
{{% /notice %}}

* Start the database and database service using the following commands:

>**NOTE**: Make sure you update the `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/create-database/db-with-pv.yaml`
>file with the name of the PVC created in the previous step. Also, update the value for all the occurrences of the namespace field
>to the namespace where the database PVC was created.

    ```bash
    $ cd weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-soa-domain/domain-home-on-pv/create-database
    $ kubectl create -f db-with-pv.yaml
    ```

The database will take several minutes to start the first time, while it
performs setup operations.  You can watch the log to see its progress using
this command:

```bash
$ kubectl logs -f oracle-db -n soans
```

A log message will indicate when the database is ready.  Also, you can
verify the database service status using this command:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods,svc -n soans |grep oracle-db
po/oracle-db   1/1       Running   0          6m
svc/oracle-db   ClusterIP   None         <none>        1521/TCP,5500/TCP   7m
```

#### Running the Repository Creation Utility to set up your database schemas

##### Creating schemas

To create the database schemas for Oracle SOA Suite, run the `create-rcu-schema.sh` script as described
[here](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/tree/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema#create-the-rcu-schema-in-the-oracle-database).

The following example shows commands you might use to execute `create-rcu-schema.sh`:

```bash
$ cd weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema
$ ./create-rcu-schema.sh \
  -s SOA1 \
  -t soaessosb \
  -d oracle-db.soans.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s \
  -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/soasuite:12.2.1.3
```

For SOA domains, the `create-rcu-schema.sh` script supports the following domain types `soa,osb,soaosb,soaess,soaessosb`.
You must specify one of these using the `-t` flag.

You need to make sure that you maintain the association between the database schemas and the
matching domain just like you did in a non-Kubernetes environment.  There is no specific
functionality provided to help with this.

##### Dropping schemas

If you want to drop the schema, you can use the `drop-rcu-schema.sh` script as described
[here](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/tree/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema#drop-the-rcu-schema-from-the-oracle-database).

The following example shows commands you might use to execute `drop-rcu-schema.sh`:

```bash
$ cd weblogic-kubernetes-operator/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema
$ ./drop-rcu-schema.sh \
  -s SOA1 \
  -t soaessosb \
  -d oracle-db.soans.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s
```

For SOA domains, the `drop-rcu-schema.sh` script supports the domain types `soa,osb,soaosb,soaess,soaessosb`.
You must specify one of these using the `-t` flag.

#### Create a Kubernetes secret with the RCU credentials

You also need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials for the database schemas.
When you create your domain using the sample provided below, it will obtain the RCU credentials
from this secret.

Use the provided sample script to create the secret as shown below:

```bash
$ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-credentials
$ ./create-rcu-credentials.sh \
  -u SOA1_SOAINFRA \
  -p Welcome1 \
  -a sys \
  -q Oradoc_db1 \
  -d soainfra \
  -n soans \
  -s soainfra-rcu-credentials
```

The parameter values are as follows:

* The schema owner user name (`-u`) must be the `schemaPrefix`
value followed by an underscore and a component name, for example `SOA1_SOAINFRA`.
* The schema owner password (`-p`) will be the password you provided for regular schema users during RCU creation.
* The database administration user (`-u`) and password (`-q`).
* The `domainUID` for the domain (`-d`).
* The namespace the domain is in (`-n`); if omitted, then `default` is assumed.
* The name of the secret (`-s`).

You can confirm the secret was created as expected with the `kubectl get secret` command.
An example is shown below, including the output:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret soainfra-rcu-credentials -o yaml -n soans
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: V2VsY29tZTE=
  sys_password: T3JhZG9jX2RiMQ==
  sys_username: c3lz
  username: U09BMQ==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-06-02T07:15:31Z
  labels:
    weblogic.domainName: soainfra
    weblogic.domainUID: soainfra
  name: soainfra-rcu-credentials
  namespace: soans
  resourceVersion: "11562794"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/soans/secrets/soainfra-rcu-credentials
  uid: 1230385e-6caa-11e9-8143-fa163efa261a
type: Opaque
```

#### Creating a SOA domain

Now that you have your Docker images and you have created your RCU schemas, you are ready
to create your domain.  To continue, follow the instructions in the [SOA Domain sample]({{< relref "/samples/simple/domains/soa-domain/_index.md" >}}).

#### Configuring a load balancer for SOA Suite domains

An Ingress based load balancer can be configured to access the Oracle SOA and Oracle Service Bus domain application URLs.
Refer to the [setup Ingress](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/ingress/) document for details.

As part of the `ingress-per-domain` setup for Oracle SOA and Oracle Service Bus domains, the `values.yaml` file (under the `ingress-per-domain` directory) needs to be updated with the appropriate values from your environment. A sample `values.yaml` file (for the Traefik load balancer) is shown below:

```bash
# Default values for ingress-per-domain.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Load balancer type.  Supported values are: TRAEFIK, VOYAGER
type: TRAEFIK

# WLS domain as backend to the load balancer
wlsDomain:
  domainUID: soainfra
  soaClusterName: soa_cluster
  osbClusterName: osb_cluster
  soaManagedServerPort: 8001
  osbManagedServerPort: 9001
  adminServerName: adminserver
  adminServerPort: 7001

# Traefik specific values
traefik:
  # hostname used by host-routing
  hostname: testhost.domain.com

# Voyager specific values
voyager:
  # web port
  webPort: 30305
  # stats port
  statsPort: 30315
```

Below are the path-based, Ingress routing rules (`spec.rules` section) that need to be defined for Oracle SOA and Oracle Service Bus domains. You need to update the appropriate Ingress template YAML file based on the load balancer being used. For example, the template YAML file for the Traefik load balancer is located at `kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain/templates/traefik-ingress.yaml`.

```bash
rules:
  - host: '{{ .Values.traefik.hostname }}'
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /console
        backend:
          serviceName: '{{ .Values.wlsDomain.domainUID }}-{{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerName | lower | replace "_" "-" }}'
          servicePort: {{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerPort }}
      - path: /em
        backend:
          serviceName: '{{ .Values.wlsDomain.domainUID }}-{{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerName | lower | replace "_" "-" }}'
          servicePort: {{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerPort }}
      - path: /servicebus
        backend:
          serviceName: '{{ .Values.wlsDomain.domainUID }}-{{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerName | lower | replace "_" "-" }}'
          servicePort: {{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerPort }}
      - path: /lwpfconsole
        backend:
          serviceName: '{{ .Values.wlsDomain.domainUID }}-{{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerName | lower | replace "_" "-" }}'
          servicePort: {{ .Values.wlsDomain.adminServerPort }}
      - path:
        backend:
          serviceName: '{{ .Values.wlsDomain.domainUID }}-cluster-{{ .Values.wlsDomain.soaClusterName | lower | replace "_" "-" }}'
          servicePort: {{ .Values.wlsDomain.soaManagedServerPort }}
```

Now you can access the Oracle SOA Suite domain URLs, as listed below, based on the domain type you selected.

* Oracle SOA:

  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/weblogic/ready  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/console  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/em  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/soa-infra  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/soa/composer  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/integration/worklistapp

* Oracle Enterprise Scheduler Service (ESS):

  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/ess  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/EssHealthCheck

* Oracle Service Bus (OSB):

  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/servicebus  
  http://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/lwpfconsole  

#### Monitoring a SOA domain

After the SOA domain is set up, you can:

* Monitor the SOA instance using Prometheus and Grafana. See [Monitoring a domain](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-monitoring-exporter).
* Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.
See [Publish logs to Elasticsearch](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-logging-exporter).
