	"content": " WebLogic domain in Docker image protection Oracle strongly recommends storing the Docker images that contain a WebLogic domain home as private in the Docker registry. In addition to any local registry, public Docker registries include Docker Hub and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR).\n The WebLogic domain home that is part of a Docker image contains sensitive information about the domain including keys and credentials that are used to access external resources (for example, data source password). In addition, the Docker image may be used to create a running server that further exposes the WebLogic domain outside of the Kubernetes cluster.\nThere are two main options to pull images from a private registry:\n Specify the image pull secret on the WebLogic Domain resource. Set up the ServiceAccount in the domain namespace with an image pull secret.  1. Use imagePullSecrets with the Domain resource. In order to access a Docker image that is protected by a private registry, the imagePullSecrets should be specified on the Kubernetes Domain resource definition:\napiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v2\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: domain1 namespace: domain1-ns labels: weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2 weblogic.domainUID: domain1 spec: domainHomeInImage: true image: \u0026quot;my-domain-home-in-image\u0026quot; imagePullPolicy: \u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; imagePullSecrets: - name: \u0026quot;my-registry-pull-secret\u0026quot; webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: \u0026quot;domain1-weblogic-credentials\u0026quot;  To create the Kubernetes secret called my-registry-pull-secret in the namespace where the domain will be running, domain1-ns, the following command can be used:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry my-registry-pull-secret \\ -n domain1-ns \\ --docker-server=\u0026lt;registry-server\u0026gt; \\ --docker-username=\u0026lt;name\u0026gt; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \\ --docker-email=\u0026lt;email\u0026gt;  For more information about creating Kubernetes secrets for accessing the registry, see the Kubernetes documentation about pulling an image from a private registry.\n2. Set up the Kubernetes ServiceAccount with imagePullSecrets. An additional option for accessing a Docker image protected by a private registry is to set up the Kubernetes ServiceAccount in the namespace running the WebLogic domain with a set of image pull secrets thus avoiding the need to set imagePullSecrets for each Domain resource being created (as each resource instance represents a WebLogic domain that the operator is managing).\nThe Kubernetes secret would be created in the same manner as shown above and then the ServiceAccount would be updated to include this image pull secret:\n$ kubectl patch serviceaccount default -n domain1-ns \\ -p '{\u0026quot;imagePullSecrets\u0026quot;: [{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;my-registry-pull-secret\u0026quot;}]}'  For more information about updating a Kubernetes ServiceAccount for accessing the registry, see the Kubernetes documentation about configuring service accounts.\n"

The Helm --recreate-pods flag is used to cause the existing kubernetes pod to be terminated and a new pod to be started with the updated configuration.\nFor example, if the operator was installed with the Helm release name weblogic-operator in the namespace weblogic-operator-ns and the kubernetes tls secret is named weblogic-operator-cert, the following commands can be used to update the operator certificate(s) and key:\n$ kubectl create secret tls weblogic-operator-cert -n weblogic-operator-ns \\ --cert=\u0026lt;path-to-certificate\u0026gt; --key=\u0026lt;path-to-private-key\u0026gt; $ helm get values weblogic-operator $ helm upgrade --wait --recreate-pods --reuse-values \\ --set externalRestEnabled=true \\ --set externalRestIdentitySecret=weblogic-operator-cert \\ weblogic-operator kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator  Additional reading  Configure the external REST interface SSL/TLS identity REST interface configuration settings Sample to create external certificate and key  "

	"content": " Creating credentials for a WebLogic domain This sample demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials for a WebLogic domain. The operator expects this secret to be named following the pattern domainUID-weblogic-credentials, where domainUID is the unique identifier of the domain. It must be in the same namespace that the domain will run in.\nTo use the sample, run the command:\n$ ./create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u username -p password -d domainUID -n namespace -s secretName  The parameters are as follows:\n -u user name, must be specified. -p password, must be specified. -d domainUID, optional. The default value is domain1. If specified, the secret will be labeled with the domainUID unless the given value is an empty string. -n namespace, optional. Use the default namespace if not specified. -s secretName, optional. If not specified, the secret name will be determined based on the domainUID value.  This creates a generic secret containing the user name and password as literal values.\nYou can check the secret with the kubectl get secret command.

By default, the script generates two YAML files, namely weblogic-sample-pv.yaml and weblogic-sample-pvc.yaml, in the /path/to/output-directory/pv-pvcs. These two YAML files can be used to create the Kubernetes resources using the kubectl create -f command.\n$ kubectl create -f weblogic-sample-pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f weblogic-sample-pvc.yaml  As a convenience, the script can optionally create the PV and PVC resources using the -e option.\nThe usage of the create script is as follows:\n$ sh create-pv-pvc.sh -h usage: create-pv-pvc.sh -i file -o dir [-e] [-h] -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified. -o Output directory for the generated yaml files, must be specified. -e Also create the Kubernetes objects using the generated yaml files -h Help  If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the \u0026lt;weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project\u0026gt;/kubernetes/samples/scripts directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.\nConfiguration parameters The PV and PVC creation inputs can be customized by editing the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     domainUID ID of the domain resource to which the generated PV and PVC will be dedicated. Leave it empty if the PV and PVC are going to be shared by multiple domains. no default   namespace Kubernetes namespace to create the PVC. default   baseName Base name of the PV and PVC. The generated PV and PVC will be \u0026lt;baseName\u0026gt;-pv and \u0026lt;baseName\u0026gt;-pvc respectively. weblogic-sample   weblogicDomainStoragePath Physical path of the storage for the PV. When weblogicDomainStorageType is set to HOST_PATH, this value should be set the to path to the domain storage on the Kubernetes host. When weblogicDomainStorageType is set to NFS, then weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer should be set to the IP address or name of the DNS server, and this value should be set to the exported path on that server. Note that the path where the domain is mounted in the WebLogic containers is not affected by this setting; that is determined when you create your domain. no default   weblogicDomainStorageReclaimPolicy Kubernetes PVC policy for the persistent storage. The valid values are: Retain, Delete, and Recycle. Retain   weblogicDomainStorageSize Total storage allocated for the PVC. 10Gi   weblogicDomainStorageType Type of storage. Legal values are NFS and HOST_PATH. If using NFS, weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer must be specified. HOST_PATH   weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer Name or IP address of the NFS server. This setting only applies if weblogicDomainStorateType is NFS. no default    Shared versus dedicated PVC By default, the domainUID is left empty in the inputs file, which means the generated PV and PVC will not be associated with a particular domain, but can be shared by multiple domain resources in the same Kubernetes namespaces as the PV and PVC.\nFor the use cases where dedicated PV and PVC are desired for a particular domain, the domainUID needs to be set in the create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml file. The presence of a non-empty domainUID in the inputs file will cause the generated PV and PVC to be associated with the specified domainUID. The association includes that the names of the generated YAML files and the Kubernetes PV and PVC objects are decorated with the domainUID, and the PV and PVC objects are also labeled with the domainUID.\nVerify the results The create script will verify that the PV and PVC were created, and will report a failure if there was any error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the PV and PVC, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs The content of the generated weblogic-sample-pvc.yaml:\n# Copyright 2018, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.

There might be intermittent failures in the operator for the period of time when the role binding was deleted.   Upgrading an operator and telling it to manage a domain namespace that another operator is already managing The helm upgrade succeeds, and silently adopts the resources the first operator\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart created in the domain namespace (for example, rolebinding), and, if you also told it to stop managing another domain namespace, it abandons the role binding it created in that namespace.\nFor example, if you delete this release, then the first operator will get messed up because the role binding it needs is gone. The big problem is that you don\u0026rsquo;t get a warning, so you don\u0026rsquo;t know that there\u0026rsquo;s a problem to fix.\n This can be fixed by just upgrading the Helm release. This may also be fixed by rolling back the Helm release.

To start, stop, or restart servers, modify these properties on the domain resource (for example, by using kubectl or the Kubernetes REST API). The operator will notice the changes and apply them.\nStarting and stopping servers The serverStartPolicy property on the domain resource controls which servers should be running. The operator runtime monitors this property and creates or deletes the corresponding server pods.\nserverStartPolicy rules You can specify the serverStartPolicy property at the domain, cluster, and server levels. Each level supports a different set of values.\nAvailable serverStartPolicy values    Level Default Value Supported Values     Domain IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY, NEVER   Cluster IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED, NEVER   Server IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED, ALWAYS, NEVER    Administration Server start and stop rules    Domain Admin Server Started / Stopped     NEVER any value Stopped   ADMIN_ONLY, IF_NEEDED NEVER Stopped   ADMIN_ONLY, IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED, ALWAYS Started    Standalone Managed Server start and stop rules    Domain Standalone Server Started / Stopped     ADMIN_ONLY, NEVER any value Stopped   IF_NEEDED NEVER Stopped   IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED, ALWAYS Started    Clustered Managed Server start and stop rules    Domain Cluster Clustered Server Started / Stopped     ADMIN_ONLY, NEVER any value any value Stopped   IF_NEEDED NEVER any value Stopped   IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED NEVER Stopped   IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED ALWAYS Started   IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED IF_NEEDED Started if needed to get to the cluster\u0026rsquo;s replicas count    Servers configured as ALWAYS count toward the cluster\u0026rsquo;s replicas count.\n If more servers are configured as ALWAYS than the cluster\u0026rsquo;s replicas count, they will all be started and the replicas count will be ignored.\n Common starting and stopping scenarios Normal running state Normally, the Administration Server, all of the standalone Managed Servers, and enough Managed Servers in each cluster to satisfy its replicas count, should be started. In this case, the domain resource does not need to specify serverStartPolicy, or list any clusters or servers, but it does need to specify a replicas count.\nFor example:\n domain: spec: image: ... replicas: 10  Shut down all the servers Sometimes you need to completely shut down the domain (for example, take it out of service).\n domain: spec: serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;NEVER\u0026quot; ...  Only start the Administration Server Sometimes you want to start the Administration Server only, that is, take the domain out of service but leave the Administration Server running so that you can administer the domain.\n domain: spec: serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;ADMIN_ONLY\u0026quot; ...  Shut down a cluster To shut down a cluster (for example, take it out of service), add it to the domain resource and set its serverStartPolicy to NEVER.\n domain: spec: clusters: - clusterName: \u0026quot;cluster1\u0026quot; serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;NEVER\u0026quot; ...  Shut down a specific standalone server To shut down a specific standalone server, add it to the domain resource and set its serverStartPolicy to NEVER.\n domain: spec: managedServers: - serverName: \u0026quot;server1\u0026quot; serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;NEVER\u0026quot; ...  Force a specific clustered Managed Server to start Normally, all of the Managed Servers in a cluster are identical and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which ones are running as long as the operator starts enough of them to get to the cluster\u0026rsquo;s replicas count. However, sometimes some of the Managed Servers are different (for example, support some extra services that the other servers in the cluster use) and need to always be started.\nThis is done by adding the server to the domain resource and setting its serverStartPolicy to ALWAYS.\n domain: spec: managedServers: - serverName: \u0026quot;cluster1_server1\u0026quot; serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;ALWAYS\u0026quot; ...  The server will count toward the cluster\u0026rsquo;s replicas count. Also, if you configure more than the replicas servers count to ALWAYS, they will all be started, even though the replicas count will be exceeded.\n Restarting servers The operator runtime automatically recreates (restarts) server pods when properties on the domain resource that affect server pods change (such as image, volumes, and env). The restartVersion property on the domain resource lets you force the operator to restart a set of server pods.\nThe operator runtime does rolling restarts of clustered servers so that service is maintained.\nProperties that cause servers to be restarted The operator will restart servers when any of the follow properties on the domain resource that affect the server are changed:\n containerSecurityContext domainHome domainHomeInImage env image imagePullPolicy imagePullSecrets includeServerOutInPodLog logHomeEnabled logHome livenessProbe nodeSelector podSecurityContext readinessProbe resources restartVersion serverStartState volumes volumeMounts  If the only change detected is the addition or modification of a domain-specified label or annotation, the operator will patch the server\u0026rsquo;s pod rather than restarting it. Removing a label or annotation from the domain resource will cause neither a restart nor a patch. It is possible to force a restart to remove such a label or annotation by modifying the restartVersion.\n Rolling restarts Clustered servers that need to be restarted are gradually restarted (for example, rolling restarted) so that the cluster is not taken out of service and in-flight work can be migrated to other servers in the cluster.\nThe maxUnavailable property on the domain resource determines how many of the cluster\u0026rsquo;s servers may be taken out of service at a time when doing a rolling restart. It can be specified at the domain and cluster levels and defaults to 1 (that is, by default, clustered servers are restarted one at a time).\nWhen using in-memory session replication, Oracle WebLogic Server employs a primary-secondary session replication model to provide high availability of application session state (that is, HTTP and EJB sessions). The primary server creates a primary session state on the server to which the client first connects, and a secondary replica on another WebLogic Server instance in the cluster. Specifying a maxUnavailable property value of 1 protects against inadvertent session state loss which could occur if both the primary and secondary servers are shut down at the same time during the rolling restart process.\nUsing restartVersion to force the operator to restart servers The restartVersion property lets you force the operator to restart servers.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s basically a user-specified string that gets added to new server pods (as a label) so that the operator can tell which servers need to be restarted. If the value is different, then the server pod is old and needs to be restarted. If the value matches, then the server pod has already been restarted.\nEach time you want to restart some servers, you need to set restartVersion to a different string (the particular value doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter).\nThe operator will notice the new value and restart the affected servers (using the same mechanisms as when other properties that affect the server pods are changed, including doing rolling restarts of clustered servers).\nThe restartVersion property can be specified at the domain, cluster, and server levels. A server will be restarted if any of these three values change.\nThe servers will also be restarted if restartVersion is removed from the domain resource (for example, if you had previously specified a value to cause a restart, then you remove that value after the previous restart has completed).\n Common restarting scenarios Restart all the servers in the domain Set restartVersion at the domain level to a new value.\n domain: spec: restartVersion: \u0026quot;domainV1\u0026quot; ...  Restart all the servers in the cluster Set restartVersion at the cluster level to a new value.\n domain: spec: clusters: - clusterName : \u0026quot;cluster1\u0026quot; restartVersion: \u0026quot;cluster1V1\u0026quot; maxUnavailable: 2 ...  Restart the Administration Server Set restartVersion at the adminServer level to a new value.\n domain: spec: adminServer: restartVersion: \u0026quot;adminV1\u0026quot; ...  Restart a standalone or clustered Managed Server Set restartVersion at the managedServer level to a new value.\n domain: spec: managedServers: - serverName: \u0026quot;standalone_server1\u0026quot; restartVersion: \u0026quot;v1\u0026quot; - serverName: \u0026quot;cluster1_server1\u0026quot; restartVersion: \u0026quot;v1\u0026quot; ...  Full domain restarts To do a full domain restart, first shut down all of the domain\u0026rsquo;s servers (Administration and Managed Servers), taking the domain out of service, then restart them. Unlike rolling restarts, the operator cannot detect and initiate a full domain restart; you must always manually initiate it.\nTo manually initiate a full domain restart:\n Change the domain level serverStartPolicy on the domain resource to NEVER.\n domain: spec: serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;NEVER\u0026quot; ...  Wait for the operator to stop ALL the servers for that domain.\n To restart the domain, set the domain level serverStartPolicy back to IF_NEEDED. Alternatively, you do not have to specify the serverStartPolicy as the default value is IF_NEEDED.\n domain: spec: serverStartPolicy: \u0026quot;IF_NEEDED\u0026quot; ...  The operator will restart all the servers in the domain.\n  "

As part of this, you must specify a \u0026ldquo;release\u0026rdquo; name for the operator.\nYou can override default configuration values in the operator Helm chart by doing one of the following:\n Creating a custom YAML file containing the values to be overridden, and specifying the --value option on the Helm command line. Overriding individual values directly on the Helm command line, using the --set option.  You supply the –namespace argument from the helm install command line to specify the namespace in which the operator should be installed. If not specified, then it defaults to default. If the namespace does not already exist, then Helm will automatically create it (and create a default service account in the new namespace), but will not remove it when the release is deleted. If the namespace already exists, then Helm will re-use it. These are standard Helm behaviors.\nSimilarly, you may override the default serviceAccount configuration value to specify which service account in the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace, the operator should use. If not specified, then it defaults to default (for example, the namespace\u0026rsquo;s default service account). If you want to use a different service account, then you must create the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace and the service account before installing the operator Helm chart.\nFor example:\n$ helm install kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --name weblogic-operator --namespace weblogic-operator-namespace \\ --values custom-values.yaml --wait  or:\n$ helm install kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --name weblogic-operator --namespace weblogic-operator-namespace \\ --set \u0026quot;javaLoggingLevel=FINE\u0026quot; --wait  This creates a Helm release, named weblogic-operator in the weblogic-operator-namespace namespace, and configures a deployment and supporting resources for the operator.\nIf weblogic-operator-namespace exists, then it will be used. If it does not exist, then Helm will create it.\nYou can verify the operator installation by examining the output from the helm install command.\nWhen the operator image is stored in a private registry, see WebLogic operator image pull secret for more information on specifying the registry credentials.\n Alternatively, install the operator Helm chart from GitHub chart repository Add this repository to the Helm installation:\n$ helm repo add weblogic-operator https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/charts  Verify that the repository was added correctly:\n$ helm repo list NAME URL weblogic-operator https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/charts  Update with the latest information about charts from the chart repositories:\n$ helm repo update  Install the operator from the repository:\n$ helm install weblogic-operator/weblogic-operator --name weblogic-operator  Removing the operator The helm delete command is used to remove an operator release and its associated resources from the Kubernetes cluster. The release name used with the helm delete command is the same release name used with the helm install command (see Install the Helm chart). For example:\n$ helm delete --purge weblogic-operator  If the operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace did not exist before the Helm chart was installed, then Helm will create it, however, helm delete will not remove it.\n After removing the operator deployment, you should also remove the domain custom resource definition:\n$ kubectl delete customresourcedefinition domains.weblogic.oracle  Note that the domain custom resource definition is shared if there are multiple operators in the same cluster.\n"

There are two main options available:\n Use a Docker image which contains the WebLogic Server binaries but not the domain, or Use a Docker image which contains both the WebLogic Server binaries and the domain directory.  If you want to use the first option, you will need to obtain the standard WebLogic Server image from the Docker store, see here; this image already contains the mandatory patches applied as described in this section. If you want to use additional patches, you can customize that process to include additional patches.\nIf you want to use the second option, which includes the domain directory inside the Docker image, then you will need to build your own Docker images as described in this section.\nSetting up secrets to access the Docker store This version of the operator requires WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 plus patch 29135930; the standard image store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 already includes this patch pre-applied.\n In order for Kubernetes to obtain the WebLogic Server Docker image from the Docker store, which requires authentication, a Kubernetes secret containing the registry credentials must be created. To create a secret with Docker store credentials, issue the following command:\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry SECRET_NAME -n NAMESPACE --docker-server=index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=YOUR_USERNAME --docker-password=YOUR_PASSWORD --docker-email=YOUR_EMAIL  In this command, replace the uppercase items with the appropriate values. The SECRET_NAME will be needed in later parameter files. The NAMESPACE must match the namespace where the first domain will be deployed, otherwise Kubernetes will not be able to find it.\nIt may be preferable to manually pull the image in advance, on each Kubernetes worker node, as described in the next section. If you choose this approach, you do not require the Kubernetes secret.\nObtaining standard images from the Docker store Oracle provides a WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 Docker image in the Docker store which already has the necessary patches applied. To obtain that image, you must have a Docker store account, log on to the Docker store, navigate to that image and click the \u0026ldquo;Proceed to Checkout\u0026rdquo; button which will prompt you to read and accept the license agreement for the image. After you have accepted the license agreement, you will be able to pull the image using your Docker store credentials.\nFirst, you will need to log in to the Docker store:\n$ docker login  Then, you can pull the image with this command:\n$ docker pull store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3  If desired, you can:\n Check the WLS version with docker run store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 sh -c 'source $ORACLE_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; java weblogic.version'\n Check the WLS patches with docker run store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 sh -c '$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches'\n  Additional information about using this image is available on the Docker store.\nCreating a custom image with patches applied The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator requires patch 29135930. This patch does have some prerequisite patches that will also need to be applied. The standard image store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 already has all of these patches applied.\nThis sample in the Oracle GitHub Docker images repository demonstrates how to create an image with arbitrary patches, starting from an unpatched WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 image (not the standard store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 pre-patched image). You can customize that sample to apply a different set of patches, if you require additional patches or PSUs.\nWhen using that sample, you will need to download the required patch and also some prerequisite patches. To find the correct version of the patch, you should use the \u0026ldquo;Product or Family (Advanced)\u0026rdquo; option, then choose \u0026ldquo;Oracle WebLogic Server\u0026rdquo; as the product, and set the release to \u0026ldquo;Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.181016\u0026rdquo; as shown in the image below:\nThe Dockerfile in that sample lists the base image as follows:\nFROM oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3-developer  You can change this to use the standard WebLogic Server image you downloaded from the Docker store by updating the FROM statement as follows:\nFROM store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3  After running docker build as described in the sample, you will have created a Docker image with the necessary patches to run WebLogic 12.2.1.3 in Kubernetes using the operator.\nCreating a custom image with your domain inside the image You can also create a Docker image with the WebLogic domain inside the image. Samples are provided that demonstrate how to create the image using:\n WLST to define the domain, or WebLogic Deploy Tooling to define the domain.  In these samples, you will see a reference to a \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; or FROM image. You should use an image with the mandatory patches installed as this base image. This image could be either the standard store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3 pre-patched image or an image you created using the instructions above.\nOracle recommends that Docker images containing WebLogic domains be kept in a private repository.\n "

	"content": "When using the operator, a WebLogic domain can be located either in a persistent volume (PV) or in a Docker image. There are advantages to both approaches, and there are sometimes technical limitations of various cloud providers that may make one approach better suited to your needs. You can also mix and match on a domain-by-domain basis.\n   Domain on a persistent volume Domain in a Docker image     Let\u0026rsquo;s you use the same standard read-only Docker image for every server in every domain. Requires a different image for each domain, but all servers in that domain use the same image.   No state is kept in Docker images making them completely throw away (cattle not pets). Runtime state should not be kept in the images, but applications and configuration are.   The domain is long-lived, so you can mutate the configuration or deploy new applications using standard methods (Administration Console, WLST, and such). If you want to mutate the domain configuration or deploy application updates, you must create a new image.   Logs are automatically placed on persistent storage. Logs are kept in the images, and sent to the pod\u0026rsquo;s log (stdout) unless you manually place them on persistent storage.   Patches can be applied by simply changing the image and rolling the domain. To apply patches, you must create a new domain-specific image and then roll the domain.   Many cloud providers do not provide persistent volumes that are shared across availability zones, so you may not be able to use a single persistent volume. You may need to use some kind of volume replication technology or a clustered file system. You do not have to worry about volume replication across availability zones since each pod has its own copy of the domain. WebLogic replication will handle propagation of any online configuration changes.   CI/CD pipelines may be more complicated because you would probably need to run WLST against the live domain directory to effect changes. CI/CD pipelines are simpler because you can create the whole domain in the image and don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about a persistent copy of the domain.   There are less images to manage and store, which could provide significant storage and network savings. There are more images to manage and store in this approach.   You may be able to use standard Oracle-provided images or, at least, a very small number of self-built images, for example, with patches installed. You may need to do more work to set up processes to build and maintain your images.    "

	"content": "This document tracks recent changes to the operator, especially ones that introduce backward incompatibilities.\n   Date Version Introduces backward incompatibilities Change     March 4, 2019 v2.0.1 no OpenShift support is now certified. Many bug fixes, including fixes for configuration overrides, cluster services, and domain status processing.   January 24, 2019 v2.0 yes; not compatible with 1.x releases, but is compatible with 2.0-rc2. Final version numbers and documentation updates.   January 16, 2019 v2.0-rc2 yes Schema updates are completed, and various bugs fixed.   December 20, 2018 v2.0-rc1 yes Operator is now installed via Helm charts, replacing the earlier scripts. The operator now supports the domain home on persistent volume or in Docker image use cases, which required a redesign of the domain schema. You can override the domain configuration using configuration override templates. Now load balancers and Ingresses can be independently configured. You can direct WebLogic logs to a persistent volume or to the pod\u0026rsquo;s log. Added lifecycle support for servers and significantly enhanced configurability for generated pods. The final v2.0 release will be the initial release where the operator team intends to provide backward compatibility as part of future releases.   March 20, 2018 v1.1 yes Several files and input parameters have been renamed. This affects how operators and domains are created. It also changes generated Kubernetes artifacts, therefore customers must recreate their operators and domains.   April 4, 2018 v1.0 yes Many Kubernetes artifact names and labels have changed. Also, the names of generated YAML files for creating a domain\u0026rsquo;s PV and PVC have changed. Because of these changes, customers must recreate their operators and domains.   May 7, 2018  no Added support for dynamic clusters, the Apache HTTP Server, the Voyager Ingress Controller, and for PV in NFS storage for multi-node environments.    "

	"description": "This document describes when to restart servers in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.",
	"content": " This document describes when to restart servers in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.\nOverview There are many situations where changes to the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment require that all the servers in a domain or cluster be restarted, for example, when applying a WebLogic Server patch or when upgrading an application.\nOne of the operator\u0026rsquo;s most important jobs is to start and stop WebLogic Servers by creating and deleting their corresponding Kubernetes pods. Sometimes, you need to make changes that make the pods obsolete, therefore the pods need to be deleted and recreated. Depending on the change, sometimes the pods can be gradually recreated, without taking the entire domain out of service (for example, rolling restarts) and sometimes all the pods need to be deleted then recreated, taking the entire domain out of service for a while (for example, full restarts).\nThe following types of server restarts are supported in Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes:\n Rolling restarts - a coordinated and controlled shut down of all of the servers in a domain or cluster while ensuring that service to the end user is not interrupted.\n Operator initiated - where the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator can detect some types of changes and will automatically initiate rolling restarts of server pods in a WebLogic domain.\n Manually initiated - required when certain changes in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment cannot be detected by the operator, so a rolling restart must be manually initiated.\n  Full domain restarts - the Administration Server and all the Managed Servers in a domain are shutdown, impacting service availability to the end user, and then restarted. Unlike a rolling restart, the operator cannot detect and initiate a full domain restart; it must always be manually initiated.\n  For detailed information on how to restart servers in a Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment, see Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.\nCommon restart scenarios This document describes what actions you need to take to properly restart your servers for a number of common scenarios:\n Modifying the WebLogic configuration Changing the custom domain configuration overrides (also called situational configuration) Changing the WebLogic Server credentials (the user name and password) Changing properties on the domain resource that affect server pods (such as image, volumes, and env) Applying WebLogic Server patches Updating deployed applications for domain home in image  Use cases Modifying the WebLogic configuration Changes to the Oracle WebLogic Server configuration may require either a rolling or full domain restart depending on the domain home location and the type of configuration change.\n Domain home in image: For domain home in image, any changes (dynamic or non-dynamic) to the WebLogic configuration requires a full domain restart.\n If you create a new image with a new name, then you must avoid a rolling restart, which can cause unexpected behavior for the running domain due to configuration inconsistencies as seen by the various servers, by following the steps in Avoiding a rolling restart when changing image property on a domain resource. If you create a new image with the same name, then you must manually initiate a full domain restart. See Full domain restarts in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.  Domain home on PV: For domain home on PV, the type of restart needed to apply the changes, depends on the nature of the WebLogic configuration change:\n Changes to parts of the WebLogic configuration that the operator introspects, require a full restart, even if the changes are dynamic. The following are the types of changes to the WebLogic Server configuration that the operator introspects:  Adding or removing a cluster, server, dynamic server, or network access point Changing a cluster, server, dynamic server, or network access point name Enabling or disabling the listen port, SSL port, or admin port Changing any port numbers Changing a network access point\u0026rsquo;s public address  Other dynamic WebLogic configuration changes do not require a restart. For example, a change to a server\u0026rsquo;s connection timeout property is dynamic and does not require a restart. Other non-dynamic WebLogic configuration changes require either a manually initiated rolling restart or a full domain restart, depending on the nature of the change. For example, a rolling restart is applicable when changing a WebLogic Server\u0026rsquo;s stuck thread timer interval property. See Restart all the servers in the domain in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.   Changing the custom domain configuration overrides Any change to domain configuration overrides requires a full domain restart. This includes:\n Changing the domain resource\u0026rsquo;s configOverides to point to a different configuration map Changing the domain resource\u0026rsquo;s configOverridesSecrets to point to a different list of secrets Changing the contents of the configuration map referenced by configOverrides Changing the contents to any of the secrets referenced by configOverridesSecrets  Changing the WebLogic Server credentials A change to the WebLogic Server credentials (the user name and password), contained in the Kubernetes secret for the domain, requires a full domain restart. The Kubernetes secret can be updated directly or a new secret can be created and then referenced by the webLogicCredentialsSecret property in the domain resource.\nChanging properties on the domain resource that affect server pods The operator will initiate a rolling restart of the domain when you modify any of the domain resource properties that affect the server pods configuration, such as image, volumes, and env. For a complete list, see Properties that cause servers to be restarted in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.\nYou can modify these properties using the kubectl command-line tool\u0026rsquo;s edit and patch commands or through the Kubernetes REST API.\nFor example, to edit the domain resource directly using the kubectl command-line tool:\nkubectl edit domain \u0026lt;domain name\u0026gt; -n \u0026lt;domain namespace\u0026gt;  The edit command opens a text editor which lets you edit the domain resource in place.\nTypically, it\u0026rsquo;s better to edit the domain resource directly; otherwise, if you scaled the domain, and you edit only the original domain.yaml file and reapply it, you could go back to your old replicas count.\n Applying WebLogic Server patches Oracle provides different types of patches for WebLogic Server, such as Patch Set Updates, Security Patch Updates, and One-Off patches. Information on whether a patch is rolling compatible or requires a manual full domain restart usually can be found in the patch\u0026rsquo;s documentation, such as the README file.\nWebLogic Server patches can be applied to either a domain home in image or a domain home on PV.\nWith rolling compatible patches:\n If you update the image property with a new image name, then the operator will initiate a rolling restart. If you keep the same image name, then you must manually initiate a rolling restart. See Restart all the servers in the domain in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.  With patches that are not rolling compatible:\n If you keep the same image name, then you must manually initiate a full domain restart. See Full domain restarts in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers. If you update the image property with a new image name, then you must avoid the rolling restart by following the steps in Avoiding a rolling restart when changing image property on a domain resource.  Updating deployed applications for domain home in image Frequent updates of deployed applications using a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) process is a very common use case. The process for applying an updated application is different for domain home in image than it is for domain home on PV. A rolling compatible application update is where some servers are running the old version and some are running the new version of the application during the rolling restart process. On the other hand, an application update that is not rolling compatible requires that all the servers in the domain be shutdown and restarted.\nIf the application update is rolling compatible:\n If you update the image property with a new image name, then the operator will initiate a rolling restart. If you keep the same image name, then you must manually initiate a rolling restart. See Restart all the servers in the domain in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.  If the application update is not rolling compatible:\n If you keep the same image name, then you must manually initiate a full domain restart. See Full domain restarts in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers. If you update the image property with a new image name, then you must avoid the rolling restart by following the steps in Avoiding a rolling restart when changing image property on a domain resource.  Rolling out an updated domain home in image Follow these steps to create new rolling compatible image if you only need to patch your WebLogic Server domain or update application deployment files:\na. Select a different name for the new image.\nb. Using the same domain home-in-image Docker image as a base, create a new Docker image by copying (COPY command in a Dockerfile) the updated application deployment files or WebLogic Server patches into the Docker image during the Docker image build.\nThe key here is to make sure that you do not re-run WLST or WDT to create a new domain home even though it will have the same configuration. Creating a new domain will change the domain secret and you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do a rolling restart.\n c. Deploy the new Docker image to your Docker repository with the new name.\nd. Update the image property of the domain resource specifying the new image name.\nFor example:\n ``` domain: spec: image: oracle/weblogic-updated:2.0.1 ```  e. The operator will now initiate a rolling restart, which will apply the updated image, for all the server pods in the domain.\nAvoiding a rolling restart when changing image property on a domain resource If you\u0026rsquo;ve created a new image that is not rolling compatible, and you\u0026rsquo;ve changed the image name, then:\n Bring the domain down (stopping all the server pods) by setting the serverStartPolicy to NEVER. See Shut down all the servers in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.\n Update the image property with a new image name.\n Start up the domain (starting all the server pods) by setting the serverStartPolicy to IF_NEEDED.\n  Other considerations for restarting a domain  Consider the order of changes:\nIf you need to make multiple changes to your domain at the same time, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to be careful about the order in which you do your changes, so that servers aren\u0026rsquo;t restarted prematurely or restarted needlessly. For example, if you want to change the readiness probe\u0026rsquo;s tuning parameters and the Java options (both of which are rolling compatible), then you should update the domain resource once, changing both values, so that the operator rolling restarts the servers once. Or, if you want to change the readiness probe\u0026rsquo;s tuning parameters (which is rolling compatible) and change the domain customizations (which require a full restart), then you should do a full shutdown first, then make the changes, and then restart the servers.\nAlternatively, if you know that your set of changes are not rolling compatible, then you must avoiding a rolling restart by:\n Bringing the domain down (stopping all the server pods) by setting the serverStartPolicy to NEVER. See Shut down all the servers in Starting, stopping, and restarting servers.\n Make all your changes to the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.\n Starting up the domain (starting all the server pods) by setting the serverStartPolicy to IF_NEEDED.\n  Changes that require domain knowledge.\nSometimes you need to make changes that require server restarts, yet the changes are not to the WebLogic configuration, the image, or the Kubernetes resources that register your domain with the operator. For example, your servers are caching information from an external database and you\u0026rsquo;ve modified the contents of the database.\nIn these cases, you must manually initiate a restart.\n  "

The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain. Optionally, the scripts start up the domain, and WebLogic Server pods and services.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, read this document, Domain resource.\nThe following prerequisites must be handled prior to running the create domain script:\n Make sure the WebLogic operator is running. The operator requires WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied. The existing WebLogic Docker image, store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3, was updated on January 17, 2019, and has all the necessary patches applied; a docker pull is required if you pulled the image prior to that date. Refer to WebLogic Docker images for details on how to obtain or create the image. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the domain unless the intention is to use the default namespace. In the same Kubernetes namespace, create the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) where the domain home will be hosted, and the Kubernetes persistent volume claim (PVC) for the domain. For samples to create a PV and PVC, see Create sample PV and PVC. By default, the create-domain.sh script creates a domain with the domainUID set to domain1 and expects the PVC domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc to be present. You can create domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc using create-pv-pvc.sh with an inputs file that has the domainUID set to domain1. Create the Kubernetes secrets username and password of the admin account in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain.  Use the script to create a domain Make a copy of the create-domain-inputs.yaml file, and run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory:\n$ ./create-domain.sh \\ -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \\ -o /path/to/output-directory  The script will perform the following steps:\n Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist. The pathname is /path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script. Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility WebLogic Server container and run offline WLST scripts, or WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) scripts, to create the domain on the shared storage. Run and wait for the job to finish. Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, domain.yaml, in the directory that is created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the kubectl create -f or kubectl apply -f command:\n$ kubectl apply -f /path/to/output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/domain.yaml  Create a convenient utility script, delete-domain-job.yaml, to clean up the domain home created by the create script.\n  As a convenience, using the -e option, the script can optionally create the domain object, which in turn results in the creation of the corresponding WebLogic Server pods and services as well.\nThe usage of the create script is as follows:\n$ sh create-domain.sh -h usage: create-domain.sh -o dir -i file [-e] [-v] [-h] -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified. -o Output directory for the generated YAML files, must be specified. -e Also create the resources in the generated YAML files, optional. -v Validate the existence of persistentVolumeClaim, optional. -h Help  If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the \u0026lt;weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project\u0026gt;/kubernetes/samples/scripts directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.\nThe default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named admin-server listening on port 7001. A dynamic cluster named cluster-1 of size 5. Two Managed Servers, named managed-server1 and managed-server2, listening on port 8001. Log files that are located in /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. No applications deployed. No data sources or JMS resources. A T3 channel.  The domain creation inputs can be customized by editing create-domain-inputs.yaml.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. admin-server   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. cluster-1   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   createDomainFilesDir Directory on the host machine to locate all the files to create a WebLogic domain, including the script that is specified in the createDomainScriptName property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path wlst, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the wlst directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path wdt, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the createDomainScriptsMountPath, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. wlst   createDomainScriptsMountPath Mount path where the create domain scripts are located inside a pod. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run the script (specified in the createDomainScriptName property) in a Kubernetes pod to create a domain home. Files in the createDomainFilesDir directory are mounted to this location in the pod, so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home. /u01/weblogic   createDomainScriptName Script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain. The create-domain.sh script creates a Kubernetes job to run this script to create a domain home. The script is located in the in-pod directory that is specified in the createDomainScriptsMountPath property. If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want the create domain job to run. create-domain-job.sh   domainHome Home directory of the WebLogic domain.

Legal values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would normally be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials. domain1-weblogic-credentials   weblogicImagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image. docker-store-secret    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create a WebLogic domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that only has one cluster. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.\nVerify the results The create script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nNote that the example results below use the default Kubernetes namespace. If you are using a different namespace, you need to replace NAMESPACE in the example kubectl commands with the actual Kubernetes namespace.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs The content of the generated domain.yaml:\n# Copyright 2017, 2019, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.

Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers. The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready before starting the Managed Servers.\nVerify the pods Use the following command to see the pods running the servers:\n$ kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE  Here is an example of the output of this command:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE domain1-admin-server 1/1 Running 0 1m domain1-managed-server1 1/1 Running 0 8m domain1-managed-server2 1/1 Running 0 8m  Verify the services Use the following command to see the services for the domain:\n$ kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE  Here is an example of the output of this command:\n$ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE domain1-admin-server ClusterIP 10.96.206.134 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 7001/TCP 23m domain1-admin-server-external NodePort 10.107.164.241 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 30012:30012/TCP 22m domain1-cluster-cluster-1 ClusterIP 10.109.133.168 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 22m domain1-managed-server1 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 22m domain1-managed-server2 ClusterIP None \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 8001/TCP 22m  Delete the generated domain home Sometimes in production, but most likely in testing environments, you might want to remove the domain home that is generated using the create-domain.sh script. Do this by running the generated delete domain job script in the /path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt; directory.\n$ kubectl create -f delete-domain-job.yaml  Troubleshooting  Message: status on iteration 20 of 20 pod domain1-create-weblogic-sample-domain-job-4qwt2 status is Pending The create domain job is not showing status completed after waiting 300 seconds.\nThe most likely cause is related to the value of persistentVolumeClaimName, defined in domain-home-on-pv/create-domain-inputs.yaml. To determine if this is the problem:\n Execute kubectl get all --all-namespaces to find the name of the create-weblogic-sample-domain-job. Execute kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;name-of-create-weblogic-sample-domain-job\u0026gt; to see if there is an event that has text similar to persistentvolumeclaim \u0026quot;domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc\u0026quot; not found. Find the name of the PVC that was created by executing create-pv-pvc.sh, using kubectl describe pvc. It is likely to be weblogic-sample-pvc. Change the value of persistentVolumeClaimName to match the name created when you executed create-pv-pvc.sh. Rerun the create-domain.sh script with the same arguments as you did before. Verify that the operator is deployed. Use the command:  kubectl get all --all-namespaces  Look for lines similar to:  weblogic-operator1 pod/weblogic-operator-  If you do not find something similar in the output, the WebLogic Operator for Kubernetes may not have been installed completely. Review the operator installation instructions.  Message: ERROR: Unable to create folder /shared/domains\nThe most common cause is a poor choice of value for weblogicDomainStoragePath in the input file used when you executed:\ncreate-pv-pvc.sh  You should delete the resources for your sample domain, correct the value in that file, and rerun the commands to create the PV/PVC and the credential before you attempt to rerun:\ncreate-domain.sh  A correct value for weblogicDomainStoragePath will meet the following requirements:\n Must be the name of a directory. The directory must be world writable.\n  Optionally, follow these steps to tighten permissions on the named directory after you run the sample the first time:\n Become the root user. ls -nd $value-of-weblogicDomainStoragePath Note the values of the third and fourth field of the output. chown $third-field:$fourth-field $value-of-weblogicDomainStoragePath chmod 755 $value-of-weblogicDomainStoragePath Return to your normal user ID.  Message: ERROR: The create domain job will not overwrite an existing domain. The domain folder /shared/domains/domain1 already exists\nYou will see this message if the directory domains/domain1 exists in the directory named as the value of weblogicDomainStoragePath in create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml. For example, if the value of weblogicDomainStoragePath is /tmp/wls-op-4-k8s, you would need to remove (or move) /tmp/wls-op-4-k8s/domains/domain1.\n  "

	"content": "  Get started  Learn about the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator, how it works and how to use it to manage WebLogic domains.\n Demo  Watch a video demonstration of the WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator.\n Architecture  The operator consists of several parts: the operator runtime, the model for a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD), a Helm chart for installing the operator, a variety of sample shell scripts for preparing or packaging WebLogic domains for running in Kubernetes, and sample Helm charts or shell scripts for conditionally exposing WebLogic endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster.\n Design philosophy  The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator (the “operator”) is designed to fulfill a similar role to that which a human operator would fill in a traditional data center deployment. It contains a set of useful built-in knowledge about how to perform various life cycle operations on a domain correctly.\n This guide provides detailed user information for the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator. It provides instructions on how to install the operator in your Kubernetes cluster and how to use it to manage WebLogic domains. If you are looking for information about how the operator is designed, implemented, built, and such, then you should refer to the Developer guide.\nImportant terms This documentation uses several important terms which are intended to have a specific meaning.\n   Term Definition     Cluster Because this term is ambiguous, it will be prefixed to indicate which type of cluster is meant. A WebLogic cluster is a group of Managed Servers that together host some application or component and which are able to share load and state between them. A Kubernetes cluster is a group of machines (“nodes”) that all host Kubernetes resources, like pods and services, and which appear to the external user as a single entity. If the term “cluster” is not prefixed, it should be assumed to mean a Kubernetes cluster.   Domain A WebLogic domain is a group of related applications and resources along with the configuration information necessary to run them.   Ingress A Kubernetes Ingress provides access to applications and services in a Kubernetes environment to external clients. An Ingress may also provide additional features like load balancing.   Namespace A Kubernetes namespace is a named entity that can be used to group together related objects, for example, pods and services.   Operator A Kubernetes operator is software that performs management of complex applications.   Pod A Kubernetes pod contains one or more containers and is the object that provides the execution environment for an instance of an application component, such as a web server or database.   Job A Kubernetes job is a type of controller that creates one or more pods that run to completion to complete a specific task.   Secret A Kubernetes secret is a named object that can store secret information like user names, passwords, X.509 certificates, or any other arbitrary data.   Service A Kubernetes service exposes application endpoints inside a pod to other pods, or outside the Kubernetes cluster. A service may also provide additional features like load balancing.    Additional reading Before using the operator, you might want to read the design philosophy to develop an understanding of the operator\u0026rsquo;s design, and the architectural overview to understand its architecture, including how WebLogic domains are deployed in Kubernetes using the operator. Also, worth reading are the details of the Kubernetes RBAC definitions required by the operator.\n"

	"content": " Cheat sheet for setting up Kubernetes If you need some help setting up a Kubernetes environment to experiment with the operator, please read on! The supported environments are either an on-premises installation of Kubernetes, for example, on bare metal, or on a cloud provider like Oracle Cloud, Google, or Amazon. Cloud providers allow you to provision a managed Kubernetes environment from their management consoles. You could also set up Kubernetes manually using compute resources on a cloud. There are also a number of ways to run a Kubernetes single-node cluster that are suitable for development or testing purposes. Your options look like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Production\u0026rdquo; options:\n Set up your own Kubernetes environment on bare compute resources on a cloud. Use your cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s management console to provision a managed Kubernetes environment. Install Kubernetes on your own compute resources (for example, \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; computers, outside a cloud).  \u0026ldquo;Development/test\u0026rdquo; options:\n Install Docker for Mac and enable its embedded Kubernetes cluster (or register for the Docker for Windows beta and wait until Kubernetes is available there). Install Minikube on your Windows/Linux/Mac computer.  We have provided our hints and tips for several of these options in the sections below.\nSet up Kubernetes on bare compute resources in a cloud Follow the basic steps from the Terraform Kubernetes installer for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nPrerequisites  Download and install Terraform (v0.10.3 or later). Download and install the OCI Terraform Provider (v2.0.0 or later). Create an Terraform configuration file at ~/.terraformrc that specifies the path to the OCI provider:  providers { oci = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;path_to_provider_binary\u0026gt;/terraform-provider-oci\u0026quot; }  Ensure that you have kubectl installed if you plan to interact with the cluster locally.  Quick Start  Do a git clone of the Terraform Kubernetes installer project:\ngit clone https://github.com/oracle/terraform-kubernetes-installer.git  Initialize your project:\ncd terraform-kubernetes-installer terraform init  Copy the example terraform.tvfars:\ncp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars  Edit the terraform.tvfars file to include values for your tenancy, user, and compartment. Optionally, edit the variables to change the Shape of the VMs for your Kubernetes master and workers, and your etcd cluster. For example:\n #give a label to your cluster to help identify it if you have multiple label_prefix=\u0026quot;weblogic-operator-1-\u0026quot; #identification/authorization info tenancy_ocid = \u0026quot;ocid1.tenancy....\u0026quot; compartment_ocid = \u0026quot;ocid1.compartment....\u0026quot; fingerprint = \u0026quot;...\u0026quot; private_key_path = \u0026quot;/Users/username/.oci/oci_api_key.pem\u0026quot; user_ocid = \u0026quot;ocid1.user...\u0026quot; #shapes for your VMs etcdShape = \u0026quot;VM.Standard1.2\u0026quot; k8sMasterShape = \u0026quot;VM.Standard1.8\u0026quot; k8sWorkerShape = \u0026quot;VM.Standard1.8\u0026quot; k8sMasterAd1Count = \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; k8sWorkerAd1Count = \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; #this ingress is set to wide-open for testing **not secure** etcd_ssh_ingress = \u0026quot;0.0.0.0/0\u0026quot; master_ssh_ingress = \u0026quot;0.0.0.0/0\u0026quot; worker_ssh_ingress = \u0026quot;0.0.0.0/0\u0026quot; master_https_ingress = \u0026quot;0.0.0.0/0\u0026quot; worker_nodeport_ingress = \u0026quot;0.0.0.0/0\u0026quot; #create iscsi volumes to store your etcd and /var/lib/docker info worker_iscsi_volume_create = true worker_iscsi_volume_size = 100 etcd_iscsi_volume_create = true etcd_iscsi_volume_size = 50  Test and apply your changes:\nterraform plan terraform apply  Test your cluster using the built-in script scripts/cluster-check.sh:\nscripts/cluster-check.sh  Output the SSH private key:\n# output the ssh private key for use later $ rm -f generated/instances_id_rsa \u0026amp;\u0026amp; terraform output ssh_private_key \u0026gt; generated/instances_id_rsa \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chmod 600 generated/instances_id_rsa  If you need shared storage between your Kubernetes worker nodes, enable and configure NFS:\n  In the current GA version, the OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes supports network block storage that can be shared across nodes with access permission RWOnce (meaning that only one can write, others can read only). If you choose to place your domain in a persistent volume, you must use a shared file system to store the WebLogic domain configuration, which MUST be accessible from all the pods across the nodes. Oracle recommends that you use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage Service (or equivalent on other cloud providers). Alternatively, you may install an NFS server on one node and share the file system across all the nodes.\nCurrently, we recommend that you use NFS version 3.0 for running WebLogic Server on OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes. During certification, we found that when using NFS 4.0, the servers in the WebLogic domain went into a failed state intermittently. Because multiple threads use NFS (default store, diagnostics store, Node Manager, logging, and domain_home), there are issues when accessing the file store. These issues are removed by changing the NFS to version 3.0.\n $ terraform output worker_public_ips IP1, IP2 $ terraform output worker_private_ips PRIVATE_IP1, PRIVATE_IP2 $ ssh -i `pwd`/generated/instances_id_rsa opc@IP1 worker-1$ sudo su - worker-1# yum install -y nfs-utils worker-1# mkdir /scratch worker-1# echo \u0026quot;/scratch PRIVATE_IP2(rw)\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/exports worker-1# systemctl restart nfs worker-1# exit worker-1$ exit # configure worker-2 to mount the share from worker-1 $ ssh -i `pwd`/generated/instances_id_rsa opc@IP2 worker-2$ sudo su - worker-2# yum install -y nfs-utils worker-2# mkdir /scratch worker-2# echo \u0026quot;PRIVATE_IP1:/scratch /scratch nfs nfsvers=3 0 0\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/fstab worker-2# mount /scratch worker-2# exit worker-2$ exit $  Install Kubernetes on your own compute resources (for example, Oracle Linux servers outside a cloud) These instructions are for Oracle Linux 7u2+. If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to adjust them accordingly.\nThese steps must be run with the root user, until specified otherwise! Any time you see YOUR_USERID in a command, you should replace it with your actual userid.\n  Choose the directories where your Docker and Kubernetes files will be stored. The Docker directory should be on a disk with a lot of free space (more than 100GB) because it will be used for the /var/lib/docker file system, which contains all of your images and containers.

	"content": " The operator consists of the following parts:\n The operator runtime, a process that runs in a Docker container deployed into a Kubernetes pod and which performs the actual management tasks. The model for a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) that when installed in a Kubernetes cluster allows the Kubernetes API server to manage instances of this new type representing the operational details and status of WebLogic domains. A Helm chart for installing the operator runtime and related resources. A variety of sample shell scripts for preparing or packaging WebLogic domains for running in Kubernetes. A variety of sample Helm charts or shell scripts for conditionally exposing WebLogic endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster.  The operator is packaged in a Docker image which you can access using the following docker pull commands:\n$ docker login $ docker pull oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:2.0.1  For more details on acquiring the operator image and prerequisites for installing the operator, consult the Quick Start guide.\nThe operator registers a Kubernetes custom resource definition called domain.weblogic.oracle (shortname domain, plural domains). More details about the domain resource type defined by this CRD, including its schema, are available here.\nThe diagram below shows the general layout of high-level components, including optional components, in a Kubernetes cluster that is hosting WebLogic domains and the operator:\nThe Kubernetes cluster has several namespaces. Components may be deployed into namespaces as follows:\n The operator is deployed into its own namespace. If the Elastic Stack integration option is configured, then a Logstash pod will also be deployed in the operator’s namespace. WebLogic domains will be deployed into various namespaces. There can be more than one domain in a namespace, if desired. There is no limit on the number of domains or namespaces that an operator can manage. Note that there can be more than one operator in a Kubernetes cluster, but each operator is configured with a list of the specific namespaces that it is responsible for. The operator will not take any action on any domain that is not in one of the namespaces the operator is configured to manage. Customers are responsible for load balancer configuration, which will typically be in the same namespace with domains or in a system, shared namespace such as the kube-system namespace. Customers are responsible for Elasticsearch and Kibana deployment, which are typically deployed in the default namespace.  Domain architecture The diagram below shows how the various parts of a WebLogic domain are manifest in Kubernetes by the operator.\nThis diagram shows the following details:\n An optional, persistent volume is created by the customer using one of the available providers. If the persistent volume is shared across the domain or members of a cluster, then the chosen provider must support “Read Write Many” access mode. The shared state on the persistent volume may include the “domain” directory, the “applications” directory, a directory for storing logs, and a directory for any file-based persistence stores. A pod is created for the WebLogic Administration Server. This pod is labeled with weblogic.domainUID, weblogic.serverName, and weblogic.domainName. One container runs in this pod. WebLogic Node Manager and Administration Server processes are run inside this container. The Node Manager process is used as an internal implementation detail for the liveness probe, for patching, and to provide monitoring and control capabilities to the Administration Console. It is not intended to be used for other purposes, and it may be removed in some future release. A ClusterIP type service is created for the Administration Server pod. This service provides a stable, well-known network (DNS) name for the Administration Server. This name is derived from the domainUID and the Administration Server name, and it is known before starting up any pod. The Administration Server ListenAddress is set to this well-known name. ClusterIP type services are only visible inside the Kubernetes cluster. They are used to provide the well-known names that all of the servers in a domain use to communicate with each other. This service is labeled with weblogic.domainUID and weblogic.domainName. A NodePort type service is optionally created for the Administration Server pod. This service provides HTTP access to the Administration Server to clients that are outside the Kubernetes cluster. This service is intended to be used to access the WebLogic Server Administration Console or for the T3 protocol for WLST connections. This service is labeled with weblogic.domainUID and weblogic.domainName. A pod is created for each WebLogic Managed Server. These pods are labeled with weblogic.domainUID, weblogic.serverName, and weblogic.domainName. One container runs in each pod. WebLogic Node Manager and Managed Server processes are run inside each of these containers. The Node Manager process is used as an internal implementation detail for the liveness probe. It is not intended to be used for other purposes, and it may be removed in some future release. A ClusterIP type service is created for each Managed Server pod that contains a Managed Server that is not part of a WebLogic cluster. These services are intended to be used to access applications running on the Managed Servers. These services are labeled with weblogic.domainUID and weblogic.domainName. Customers must expose these services using a load balancer or NodePort type service to expose these endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster. An Ingress may optionally be created by the customer for each WebLogic cluster. An Ingress provides load balanced HTTP access to all Managed Servers in that WebLogic cluster. The load balancer updates its routing table for an Ingress every time a Managed Server in the WebLogic cluster becomes “ready” or ceases to be able to service requests, such that the Ingress always points to just those Managed Servers that are able to handle user requests.  The diagram below shows the components inside the containers running WebLogic Server instances:\nThe domain resource specifies a Docker image, defaulting to store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3. All containers running WebLogic Server use this same Docker image. Depending on the use case, this image could contain the WebLogic Server product binaries or also include the domain directory. During a rolling event caused by a change to the domain resource\u0026rsquo;s image field, containers will be using a mix of the updated value of the image field and its previous value.\n Within the container, the following aspects are configured by the operator:\n The ENTRYPOINT is configured by a script that starts up a Node Manager process, and then uses WLST to request that Node Manager start the server. Node Manager is used to start servers so that the socket connection to the server will be available to obtain server status even when the server is unresponsive. This is used by the liveness probe. The liveness probe is configured to check that the server is alive by querying the Node Manager process. The liveness probe is by default configured to check liveness every 15 seconds, and to timeout after 5 seconds. If a pod fails the liveness probe, Kubernetes will restart that container. The readiness probe is configured to use the WebLogic Server ReadyApp framework. The readiness probe is used to determine if the server is ready to accept user requests. The readiness is used to determine when a server should be included in a load balancer\u0026rsquo;s endpoints, when a restarted server is fully started in the case of a rolling restart, and for various other purposes. A shutdown hook is configured that will execute a script that performs a graceful shutdown of the server. This ensures that servers have an opportunity to shut down cleanly before they are killed.  Domain state stored outside Docker images The operator expects (and requires) that all state be stored outside of the Docker images that are used to run the domain. This means either in a persistent file system, or in a database. The WebLogic configuration, that is, the domain directory and the applications directory may come from the Docker image or a persistent volume. However, other state, such as file-based persistent stores, and such, must be stored on a persistent volume or in a database. All of the containers that are participating in the WebLogic domain use the same image, and take on their personality; that is, which server they execute, at startup time. Each pod mounts storage, according to the domain resource, and has access to the state information that it needs to fulfill its role in the domain.\nIt is worth providing some background information on why this approach was adopted, in addition to the fact that this separation is consistent with other existing operators (for other products) and the Kubernetes “cattle, not pets” philosophy when it comes to containers.\nThe external state approach allows the operator to treat the Docker images as essentially immutable, read-only, binary images. This means that the image needs to be pulled only once, and that many domains can share the same image. This helps to minimize the amount of bandwidth and storage needed for WebLogic Server Docker images.\nThis approach also eliminates the need to manage any state created in a running container, because all of the state that needs to be preserved is written into either the persistent volume or a database back end. The containers and pods are completely throwaway and can be replaced with new containers and pods, as necessary. This makes handling failures and rolling restarts much simpler because there is no need to preserve any state inside a running container.\nWhen users wish to apply a binary patch to WebLogic Server, it is necessary to create only a single new, patched Docker image. If desired, any domains that are running may be updated to this new patched image with a rolling restart, because there is no state in the containers.\nIt is envisaged that in some future release of the operator, it will be desirable to be able to “move” or “copy” domains in order to support scenarios like Kubernetes federation, high availability, and disaster recovery. Separating the state from the running containers is seen as a way to greatly simplify this feature, and to minimize the amount of data that would need to be moved over the network, because the configuration is generally much smaller than the size of WebLogic Server Docker images.\nThe team developing the operator felt that these considerations provided adequate justification for adopting the external state approach.\nNetwork name predictability The operator uses services to provide stable, well-known DNS names for each server. These names are known in advance of starting up a pod to run a server, and are used in the ListenAddress fields in the WebLogic Server configuration to ensure that servers will always be able to find each other. This also eliminates the need for pod names or the actual WebLogic Server instance names to be the same as the DNS addresses.\n"

	"description": "Sample for creating a WebLogic domain home inside a Docker image, and the domain resource YAML file for deploying the generated WebLogic domain.",
	"content": " The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a WebLogic domain home in a Docker image using one of the domain home in image samples in the WebLogic Server domain Docker image samples GitHub project. The sample scripts have an option of putting the WebLogic domain log, server logs, server output files, and the Node Manager logs on an existing Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used by the scripts or used manually to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain, including the WebLogic Server pods and services.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, read this document, Domain resource.\nThe following prerequisites must be handled prior to running the create domain script:\n The WDT sample requires that JAVA_HOME is set to a Java JDK version 1.8 or later. The operator requires WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied. The existing WebLogic Docker image, store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3, was updated on January 17, 2019, and has all the necessary patches applied; a docker pull is required if you pulled the image prior to that date. Refer to WebLogic Docker images for details on how to obtain or create the image. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the domain unless the intention is to use the default namespace. If logHomeOnPV is enabled, create the Kubernetes persistent volume where the log home will be hosted, and the Kubernetes persistent volume claim for the domain in the same Kubernates namespace. For samples to create a PV and PVC, see Create sample PV and PVC. Create a Kubernetes secret for the WebLogic administrator credentials that contains the fields username and password, and make sure that the secret name matches the value specified for weblogicCredentialsSecretName (see Configuration table below). For example:  $ cd ./kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain-credentials $ create-weblogic-credentials.sh -u weblogic -p welcome1 -d domain1 -n default -s domain1-weblogic-credentials  NOTE: Then make sure to configure weblogicCredentialsSecretName to be domain1-weblogic-credentials.\nUse the script to create a domain The create-domain.sh script generates a new Docker image on each run with a new domain home and a different internal domain secret in it. To prevent having disparate images with different domain secrets in the same domain, we strongly recommend that a new domain uses a domainUID that is different from any of the active domains, or that you delete the existing domain resource using the following command and wait until all the server pods are terminated before you create a domain with the same domainUID:\n $kubectl delete domain [domainUID] -n [domainNamespace]  Make a copy of the create-domain-inputs.yaml file, and run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory:\n$ ./create-domain.sh \\ -u \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; \\ -p \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \\ -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \\ -o /path/to/output-directory  The script will perform the following steps:\n Create a directory for the generated properties and Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist. The pathname is /path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. If the directory already exists, its contents will be removed. Create a properties file, domain.properties, in the directory that is created above. This properties file will be used to create a sample WebLogic Server domain. Clone the WebLogic docker-images project into the directory that is derived from the domainHomeImageBuildPath property using git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git. By default, the script always cleans up the directory and clones it again on every run. You need to specify the -k option if you want to use a previously cloned project. Note that if the specified domainHomeImageBuildPath is empty, the script will still clone the project even if the -k option is specified. Replace the built-in user name and password in the properties/docker-build/domain_security.properties file with the username and password that are supplied on the command line using the -u and -p options. These credentials need to match the WebLogic domain admin credentials in the secret that is specified via the weblogicCredentialsSecretName property in the create-domain-inputs.yaml file. Build a Docker image based on the Docker sample, Example Image with a WebLogic Server Domain using the Oracle WebLogic Scripting Tooling (WLST) or Example Image with a WebLogic Server Domain using the Oracle WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT). It will create a sample WebLogic Server domain in the Docker image. Oracle strongly recommends storing the image containing the domain home as private in the registry (for example, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry, Docker Hub, and such) as this image contains sensitive information about the domain including keys and credentials that are used to access external resources (for example, data source password). For more information about domain home in image protection, see the Security section.\n  Create a tag that refers to the generated Docker image. Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, domain.yaml, in the directory that is created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the kubectl create -f or kubectl apply -f command.  $ kubectl apply -f /path/to/output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/domain.yaml   As a convenience, using the -e option, the script can optionally create the domain object, which in turn results in the creation of the corresponding WebLogic Server pods and services. This option should be used in a single node Kubernetes cluster only.\nFor a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, make sure that the generated image is available on all nodes before creating the domain resource using the kubectl apply -f command.\nThe usage of the create script is as follows:\n$ sh create-domain.sh -h usage: create-domain.sh -o dir -i file -u username -p password [-k] [-e] [-h] -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified. -o Ouput directory for the generated properties and YAML files, must be specified. -u User name used in building the Docker image for WebLogic domain in image. -p Password used in building the Docker image for WebLogic domain in image. -e Also create the resources in the generated YAML files, optional. -v Validate the existence of persistentVolumeClaim, optional. -k Keep what has been previously cloned from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git, optional. If not specified, this script will always remove the existing project and clone again. -h Help  If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the \u0026lt;weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project\u0026gt;/kubernetes/samples/scripts directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.\nThe default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:\n An Administration Server named admin-server listening on port 7001. A dynamic cluster named cluster-1 of size 5. Two Managed Servers, named managed-server1 and managed-server2, listening on port 8001. No applications deployed. A T3 channel.  If you run the sample from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster, and you need to push the new image to a registry that is local to the cluster, you need to do the following (also see the image property in the Configuration parameters table in the next section):\n Set the image property in the inputs file to the target image name (including the registry hostname/port and the tag, if needed). Run the create-domain.sh script without the -e option. Push the image to the target registry. Run the following command to create the domain:  $ kubectl apply -f /path/to/output-directory/weblogic-domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/domain.yaml  The domain creation inputs can be customized by editing create-domain-inputs.yaml.\nConfiguration parameters The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.\n   Parameter Definition Default     adminPort Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. 7001   adminNodePort Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. 30701   adminServerName Name of the Administration Server. admin-server   clusterName Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. cluster-1   configuredManagedServerCount Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. 5   domainHomeImageBase Base WebLogic binary image used to build the WebLogic domain image. The operator requires WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied. The existing WebLogic Docker image, store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3, was updated on January 17, 2019, and has all the necessary patches applied; a docker pull is required if you pulled the image prior to that date. Refer to WebLogic Docker images for details on how to obtain or create the image. store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3   domainHomeImageBuildPath Location of the WebLogic \u0026ldquo;domain home in image\u0026rdquo; Docker image in https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git project. If not specified, use \u0026ldquo;./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image\u0026rdquo;. Another possible value is \u0026ldquo;./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt\u0026rdquo; which uses WDT, instead of WLST, to generate the domain configuration. ./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image   domainPVMountPath Mount path of the domain persistent volume. This parameter is required if logHomeOnPV is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. /shared   domainUID Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. domain1   exposeAdminNodePort Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. false   exposeAdminT3Channel Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. false   image WebLogic Server Docker image that the operator uses to start the domain. The create domain scripts generate a WebLogic Server Docker image with a domain home in it. By default, the scripts tag the generated WebLogic server Docker image as either domain-home-in-image or domain-home-in-image-wdt based on the domainHomeImageBuildPath property, and use it plus the tag that is obtained from the domainHomeImageBase to set the image element in the generated domain YAML file. If this property is set, the create domain scripts will use the value specified, instead of the default value, to tag the generated image and set the image in the domain YAML file. A unique value is required for each domain that is created using the scripts. If you are running the sample scripts from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster where the domain is going to be running, you need to set this property to the image name that is intended to be used in a registry local to that Kubernetes cluster. You also need to push the image to that registry before starting the domain using the kubectl create -f or kubectl apply -f command.    imagePullPolicy WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are IfNotPresent, Always, or Never. IfNotPresent   imagePullSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified.    includeServerOutInPodLog Boolean indicating whether to include server.out to the pod\u0026rsquo;s stdout. true   initialManagedServerReplicas Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. 2   javaOptions Java options for starting the Administration and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: $(DOMAIN_NAME), $(DOMAIN_HOME), $(ADMIN_NAME), $(ADMIN_PORT), and $(SERVER_NAME). -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false   logHomeOnPV Specifies whether the log home is stored on the persistent volume. If set to true, then you must specify the logHome, persistentVolumeClaimName and domainPVMountPath parameters. false   logHome The in-pod location for domain log, server logs, server out, and Node Manager log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as /shared/logs/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;. This parameter is required if logHomeOnPV is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. /shared/logs/domain1   managedServerNameBase Base string used to generate Managed Server names. managed-server   managedServerPort Port number for each Managed Server. 8001   namespace Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. default   persistentVolumeClaimName Name of the persistent volume claim. If not specified, the value is derived from the domainUID as \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-sample-pvc. This parameter is required if logHomeOnPV is true. Otherwise, it is ignored. domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc   productionModeEnabled Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. true   serverStartPolicy Determines which WebLogic Servers will be started up. Legal values are NEVER, IF_NEEDED, ADMIN_ONLY. IF_NEEDED   t3ChannelPort Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. 30012   t3PublicAddress Public address for the T3 channel. This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster. This would normally be a load balancer address. For development environments only: In a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the kubernetes cluster   weblogicCredentialsSecretName Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server\u0026rsquo;s user name and password. domain1-weblogic-credentials    Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the create-inputs.yaml file. Those properties include the adminServerName, clusterName and managedServerNameBase. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) is converted to a hyphen (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;).\nThe sample demonstrates how to create a WebLogic domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that has only one cluster. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. Also, the generated domain YAML file can be modified to cover more use cases.\nVerify the results The create script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error. However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.\nNote that the example results below use the default Kubernetes namespace. If you are using a different namespace, you need to replace NAMESPACE in the example kubectl commands with the actual Kubernetes namespace.\nGenerated YAML files with the default inputs The content of the generated domain.yaml:\n# Copyright 2017, 2019, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.

The build machine will also need to have Docker installed.\nTo build the operator, issue the following command in the project directory:\n$ mvn clean install  This will compile the source files, build JAR files containing the compiled classes and libraries needed to run the operator, and will also execute all of the unit tests.\nContributions must conform to coding and formatting standards. To automatically update local code to conform to formatting standards, issue the following command:\n$ mvn fmt:format  Building Javadoc To build the Javadoc for the operator, issue the following command:\n$ mvn javadoc:javadoc  The Javadoc is also available in the GitHub repository here.\nBuilding the operator Docker image Log in to the Docker Store so that you will be able to pull the base image and create the Docker image as follows. These commands should be executed in the project root directory:\n$ docker login $ docker build --build-arg VERSION=\u0026lt;version\u0026gt; -t weblogic-kubernetes-operator:some-tag --no-cache=true .  Replace \u0026lt;version\u0026gt; with the version of the project found in the pom.xml file in the project root directory.\nIf you have not used the base image (store/oracle/serverjre:8) before, you will need to visit the Docker Store web interface and accept the license agreement before the Docker Store will give you permission to pull that image.\n We recommend that you use a tag other than latest, to make it easy to distinguish your image. In the example above, the tag could be the GitHub ID of the developer.\nRunning the operator from an IDE The operator can be run from an IDE, which is useful for debugging. In order to do so, the machine running the IDE must be configured with a Kubernetes configuration file in ~/.kube/config or in a location pointed to by the KUBECONFIG environment variable.\nConfigure the IDE to run the class oracle.kubernetes.operator.Main.\nYou may need to create a directory called /operator on your machine. Please be aware that the operator code is targeted to Linux, and although it will run fine on macOS, it will probably not run on other operating systems. If you develop on another operating system, you should deploy the operator to a Kubernetes cluster and use remote debugging instead.\nRunning the operator in a Kubernetes cluster If you\u0026rsquo;re not running Kubernetes on your development machine, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make the Docker image available to a registry visible to your Kubernetes cluster. Either docker push the image to a private registry or upload your image to a machine running Docker and Kubernetes as follows:\n# on your build machine $ docker save weblogic-kubernetes-operator:some-tag \u0026gt; operator.tar $ scp operator.tar YOUR_USER@YOUR_SERVER:/some/path/operator.tar # on the Kubernetes server $ docker load \u0026lt; /some/path/operator.tar  Use the Helm charts to install the operator.\nIf the operator\u0026rsquo;s behavior or pod log is insufficient to diagnose and resolve failures, then you can connect a Java debugger to the operator using the debugging options.\n"

	"description": "Use the operator&#39;s REST services",
	"content": " Use the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST services The operator provides a REST server which you can use to get a list of WebLogic domains and clusters and to initiate scaling operations. Swagger documentation for the REST API is available here.\nYou can access most of the REST services using GET, for example:\n To obtain a list of domains, send a GET request to the URL /operator/latest/domains To obtain a list of clusters in a domain, send a GET request to the URL /operator/latest/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/clusters  All of the REST services require authentication. Callers must pass in a valid token header and a CA certificate file. Callers should pass in the Accept:/application/json header.\nTo protect against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, the operator REST API requires that you send in a X-Requested-By header when you invoke a REST endpoint that makes a change (for example when you POST to the /scale endpoint). The value is an arbitrary name such as MyClient. For example, when using curl:\ncurl ... -H X-Requested-By:MyClient ... -X POST .../scaling  If you do not pass in the X-Requested-By header, then you\u0026rsquo;ll get a 400 (bad request) response without any details explaining why the request is bad. The X-Requested-By header is not needed for requests that only read, for example when you GET any of the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST endpoints.\nBefore using the sample script below, you must:\n Update it to ensure it has the correct service account, namespaces, etc., and it points to the values.yaml that you used to install the operator (so that it can get the certificates). Add your operator\u0026rsquo;s certificate to your operating system\u0026rsquo;s trust store (see below). If you are using a self-signed certificate and your client is macOS, you may need to update the version of curl you have installed. The version of CURL that ships with macOS High Sierra (curl 7.54.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin17.0) libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.0.20 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.0) has known issues with self-signed certificates. Oracle recommends curl 7.63.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0) libcurl/7.63.0 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.11 which can be installed with brew install curl.  How to add your certificate to your operating system trust store For macOS, find the certificate in Finder, and double-click on it. This will add it to your keystore and open Keychain Access. Find the certificate in Keychain Access and double-click on it to open the details. Open the \u0026ldquo;Trust\u0026rdquo; pull-down menu and set the value of \u0026ldquo;When using this certificate\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Always Trust\u0026rdquo;, then close the detail window and enter your password when prompted.\nFor Oracle Linux, run the script below once to copy the certificate into /tmp/operator.cert.pem then run these commands to add the certificate to the trust store:\n$ sudo cp /tmp/operator.cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ $ sudo update-ca-trust enable; sudo update-ca-trust extract $ openssl x509 -noout -hash -in /tmp/operator.cert.pem $ sudo ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/operator.cert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/e242d2da.0  In the final command, the filename e242d2da.0 should be the output of the previous command plus the suffix .0.\nPlease consult your operating system\u0026rsquo;s documentation (or Google) for other operating systems.\nSample operator REST client script Here is a small sample BASH script that may help to prepare the necessary token, certificates, and such, to call the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST services. Please read the important caveats above before using this script:\n#!/bin/bash KUBERNETES_SERVER=$1 URL_TAIL=$2 REST_PORT=`kubectl get services -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name == \u0026quot;external-weblogic-operator-svc\u0026quot;)].spec.ports[?(@.name == \u0026quot;rest\u0026quot;)].nodePort}'` REST_ADDR=\u0026quot;https://${KUBERNETES_SERVER}:${REST_PORT}\u0026quot; SECRET=`kubectl get serviceaccount weblogic-operator -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}'` ENCODED_TOKEN=`kubectl get secret ${SECRET} -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.data.token}'` TOKEN=`echo ${ENCODED_TOKEN} | base64 --decode` OPERATOR_CERT_SECRET=`grep externalRestIdentitySecret weblogic-operator.yaml | awk '{ print $2 }'` OPERATOR_CERT_DATA=`kubectl get secret ${OPERATOR_CERT_SECRET} -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\\.crt}'` OPERATOR_CERT_FILE=\u0026quot;/tmp/operator.cert.pem\u0026quot; echo ${OPERATOR_CERT_DATA} | base64 --decode \u0026gt; ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE} cat ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE} echo \u0026quot;Ready to call operator REST APIs\u0026quot; STATUS_CODE=`curl \\ -v \\ --cacert ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE} \\ -H \u0026quot;Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\u0026quot; \\ -H Accept:application/json \\ -X GET ${REST_ADDR}/${URL_TAIL} \\ -o curl.out \\ --stderr curl.err \\ -w \u0026quot;%{http_code}\u0026quot;` cat curl.err cat curl.out | jq .  You can use the -k option to bypass the check to verify that the operator\u0026rsquo;s certificate is trusted (instead of curl --cacert), but this is insecure.\n To use this script, pass in the Kubernetes server address and then the URL you want to call.

	"description": "The operator provides several ways to initiate scaling of WebLogic clusters.",
	"content": " WebLogic Server supports two types of clustering configurations, configured and dynamic. Configured clusters are created by manually configuring each individual Managed Server instance. In dynamic clusters, the Managed Server configurations are generated from a single, shared template. With dynamic clusters, when additional server capacity is needed, new server instances can be added to the cluster without having to manually configure them individually. Also, unlike configured clusters, scaling up of dynamic clusters is not restricted to the set of servers defined in the cluster but can be increased based on runtime demands. For more information on how to create, configure, and use dynamic clusters in WebLogic Server, see Dynamic Clusters.\nThe following blogs provide more in-depth information on support for scaling WebLogic clusters in Kubernetes:\n Automatic Scaling of WebLogic Clusters on Kubernetes WebLogic Dynamic Clusters on Kubernetes  The operator provides several ways to initiate scaling of WebLogic clusters, including:\n On-demand, updating the domain resource directly (using kubectl). Calling the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API, for example, from curl. Using a WLDF policy rule and script action to call the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API. Using a Prometheus alert action to call the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API.  On-demand, updating the domain resource directly The easiest way to scale a WebLogic cluster in Kubernetes is to simply edit the replicas property within a domain resource. This can be done by using the kubectl command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. More specifically, you can modify the domain resource directly by using the kubectl edit command. For example:\n$ kubectl edit domain domain1 -n [namespace]  Here we are editing a domain resource named domain1. The kubectl edit command will open the domain resource definition in an editor and allow you to modify the replicas value directly. Once committed, the operator will be notified of the change and will immediately attempt to scale the corresponding dynamic cluster by reconciling the number of running pods/Managed Server instances with the replicas value specification.\nspec: ... clusters: - clusterName: cluster-1 replicas: 1 ...  Alternatively, you can specify a default replicas value for all the clusters. If you do this, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to list the cluster in the domain resource (unless you want to customize another property of the cluster).\nspec: ... replicas: 1 ...  Calling the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API Scaling up or scaling down a WebLogic cluster provides increased reliability of customer applications as well as optimization of resource usage. In Kubernetes cloud environments, scaling WebLogic clusters involves scaling the corresponding pods in which WebLogic Managed Server instances are running. Because the operator manages the life cycle of a WebLogic domain, the operator exposes a REST API that allows an authorized actor to request scaling of a WebLogic cluster.\nThe following URL format is used for describing the resources for scaling (up and down) a WebLogic cluster:\nhttp(s)://${OPERATOR_ENDPOINT}/operator/\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;/domains/\u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;/clusters/\u0026lt;clusterName\u0026gt;/scale  For example:\nhttp(s)://${OPERATOR_ENDPOINT}/operator/v1/domains/domain1/clusters/cluster-1/scale  In this URL format:\n OPERATOR_ENDPOINT is the host and port of the operator REST endpoint (internal or external). \u0026lt;version\u0026gt; denotes the version of the REST resource. \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt; is the unique identifier of the WebLogic domain. \u0026lt;clusterName\u0026gt; is the name of the WebLogic cluster to be scaled.  The /scale REST endpoint accepts an HTTP POST request and the request body supports the JSON \u0026quot;application/json\u0026quot; media type. The request body will be a simple name-value item named managedServerCount; for example:\n{ \u0026quot;managedServerCount\u0026quot;: 3 }  The managedServerCount value designates the number of WebLogic Server instances to scale to. Note that the scale resource is implemented using the JAX-RS framework, and so a successful scaling request will return an HTTP response code of 204 (“No Content”) because the resource method’s return type is void and does not return a message body.\nWhen you POST to the /scale REST endpoint, you must send the following headers:\n X-Requested-By request value. The value is an arbitrary name such as MyClient.\n Authorization: Bearer request value. The value of the Bearer token is the WebLogic domain service account token.  For example, when using curl:\ncurl -v -k -H X-Requested-By:MyClient -H Content-Type:application/json -H Accept:application/json -H \u0026quot;Authorization:Bearer ...\u0026quot; -d '{ \u0026quot;managedServerCount\u0026quot;: 3 }' https://.../scaling  If you omit the header, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a 400 (bad request) response without any details explaining why the request was bad. If you omit the Bearer Authentication header, then you\u0026rsquo;ll get a 401 (Unauthorized) response.\nOperator REST endpoints The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator can expose both an internal and external REST HTTPS endpoint. The internal REST endpoint is only accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster. The external REST endpoint is accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster. The internal REST endpoint is enabled by default and thus always available, whereas the external REST endpoint is disabled by default and only exposed if explicitly configured. Detailed instructions for configuring the external REST endpoint are available here.\nRegardless of which endpoint is being invoked, the URL format for scaling is the same.\n What does the operator do in response to a scaling request? When the operator receives a scaling request, it will:\n Perform an authentication and authorization check to verify that the specified user is allowed to perform the specified operation on the specified resource. Validate that the specified domain, identified by domainUID, exists. Validate that the WebLogic cluster, identified by clusterName, exists. Verify that the specified WebLogic cluster has a sufficient number of configured servers to satisfy the scaling request. Initiate scaling by setting the replicas property within the corresponding domain resource, which can be done in either:  A cluster entry, if defined within its cluster list. At the domain level, if not defined in a cluster entry.   In response to a change to either replicas property, in the domain resource, the operator will increase or decrease the number of pods (Managed Servers) to match the desired replica count.\nUsing a WLDF policy rule and script action to call the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API The WebLogic Diagnostics Framework (WLDF) is a suite of services and APIs that collect and surface metrics that provide visibility into server and application performance. To support automatic scaling of WebLogic clusters in Kubernetes, WLDF provides the Policies and Actions component, which lets you write policy expressions for automatically executing scaling operations on a cluster. These policies monitor one or more types of WebLogic Server metrics, such as memory, idle threads, and CPU load. When the configured threshold in a policy is met, the policy is triggered, and the corresponding scaling action is executed. The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator project provides a shell script, scalingAction.sh, for use as a Script Action, which illustrates how to issue a request to the operator’s REST endpoint.\nConfigure automatic scaling of WebLogic clusters in Kubernetes with WLDF The following steps are provided as a guideline on how to configure a WLDF Policy and Script Action component for issuing scaling requests to the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST endpoint:\n Copy the scalingAction.sh script to a directory (such as $DOMAIN_HOME/bin/scripts) so that it\u0026rsquo;s accessible within the Administration Server pod.\n Configure a WLDF policy and action as part of a diagnostic module targeted to the Administration Server. For information about configuring the WLDF Policies and Actions component, see Configuring Policies and Actions in Configuring and Using the Diagnostics Framework for Oracle WebLogic Server.\na. Configure a WLDF policy with a rule expression for monitoring WebLogic Server metrics, such as memory, idle threads, and CPU load for example.\nb. Configure a WLDF script action and associate the scalingAction.sh script.\n  Important notes about the configuration properties for the Script Action:\nThe scalingAction.sh script requires access to the SSL certificate of the operator’s endpoint and this is provided through the environment variable INTERNAL_OPERATOR_CERT.\nThe operator’s SSL certificate can be found in the internalOperatorCert entry of the operator’s ConfigMap weblogic-operator-cm:\nFor example:\n#\u0026gt; kubectl describe configmap weblogic-operator-cm -n weblogic-operator ... Data ==== internalOperatorCert: ---- LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUR3akNDQXFxZ0F3SUJBZ0lFRzhYT1N6QU... ...  The scalingAction.sh script accepts a number of customizable parameters:\n action - scaleUp or scaleDown (Required)\n domain_uid - WebLogic domain unique identifier (Required)\n cluster_name - WebLogic cluster name (Required)\n kubernetes_master - Kubernetes master URL, default=https://kubernetes\n  Set this to https://kubernetes.default.svc when invoking scalingAction.sh from the Administration Server pod.\n  access_token - Service Account Bearer token for authentication and authorization for access to REST Resources\n wls_domain_namespace - Kubernetes namespace in which the WebLogic domain is defined, default=default\n operator_service_name - WebLogic Operator Service name of the REST endpoint, default=internal-weblogic-operator-service\n operator_service_account - Kubernetes Service Account name for the WebLogic Operator, default=weblogic-operator\n operator_namespace – Namespace in which the WebLogic Operator is deployed, default=weblogic-operator\n scaling_size – Incremental number of WebLogic Server instances by which to scale up or down, default=1\n  You can use any of the following tools to configure policies for diagnostic system modules:\n WebLogic Server Administration Console WLST REST JMX application\n  A more in-depth description and example on using WLDF\u0026rsquo;s Policies and Actions component for initiating scaling requests through the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST endpoint can be found in the blogs:\n Automatic Scaling of WebLogic Clusters on Kubernetes WebLogic Dynamic Clusters on Kubernetes  Create cluster role bindings to allow a namespace user to query WLS Kubernetes cluster information The script scalingAction.sh, specified in the WLDF script action above, needs the appropriate RBAC permissions granted for the service account user (in the namespace in which the WebLogic domain is deployed) in order to query the Kubernetes API server for both configuration and runtime information of the domain resource. The following is an example YAML file for creating the appropriate Kubernetes cluster role bindings:\nIn the example cluster role binding definition below, the WebLogic domain is deployed to a namespace weblogic-domain. Replace the namespace value with the name of the namespace in which the WebLogic domain is deployed in your Kubernetes environment.\n kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: weblogic-domain-cluster-role rules: - apiGroups: [\u0026quot;weblogic.oracle\u0026quot;] resources: [\u0026quot;domains\u0026quot;] verbs: [\u0026quot;get\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;list\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;update\u0026quot;] --- # # creating role-bindings for cluster role # kind: ClusterRoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: domain-cluster-rolebinding subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default namespace: weblogic-domain apiGroup: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: weblogic-domain-cluster-role apiGroup: \u0026quot;rbac.authorization.k8s.io\u0026quot; --- # # creating role-bindings # kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: weblogic-domain-operator-rolebinding namespace: weblogic-operator subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default namespace: weblogic-domain apiGroup: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin apiGroup: \u0026quot;rbac.authorization.k8s.io\u0026quot; ---  Using a Prometheus alert action to call the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST scale API In addition to using the WebLogic Diagnostic Framework for automatic scaling of a dynamic cluster, you can use a third-party monitoring application like Prometheus. Please read the following blog for details about Using Prometheus to Automatically Scale WebLogic Clusters on Kubernetes.\nHelpful Tips Debugging scalingAction.sh The scalingAction.sh script was designed to be executed within the Administration Server pod because the associated diagnostic module is targed to the Administration Server.\nThe easiest way to verify and debug the scalingAction.sh script is to open a shell on the running Administration Server pod and execute the script on the command line.\nThe following example illustrates how to open a bash shell on a running Administration Server pod named domain1-admin-server and execute the scriptAction.sh script. It assumes that:\n The domain home is in /u01/oracle/user-projects/domains/domain1 (that is, the domain home is inside a Docker image). The Dockerfile copied scalingAction.sh to /u01/oracle/user-projects/domains/domain1/bin/scripts/scalingAction.sh.  \u0026gt; kubectl exec -it domain1-admin-server /bin/bash # bash\u0026gt; cd /u01/oracle/user-projects/domains/domain1/bin/scripts # bash\u0026gt; ./scalingAction.sh  A log, scalingAction.log, will be generated in the same directory in which the script was executed and can be examined for errors.\nExample on accessing the external REST endpoint The easiest way to test scaling using the external REST endpoint is to use a command-line tool like curl. Using curl to issue an HTTPS scale request requires these mandatory header properties:\n Bearer Authorization token SSL certificate for the operator\u0026rsquo;s external REST endpoint X-Requested-By header value  The following shell script is an example of how to issue a scaling request, with the necessary HTTP request header values, using curl. This example assumes the operator and domain resource are configured with the following properties in Kubernetes:\n Operator properties:  externalRestEnabled: true externalRestHttpsPort: 31001 operator\u0026rsquo;s namespace: weblogic-operator operator\u0026rsquo;s hostname is the same as the host shell script is executed on.  Domain resource properties:\n WebLogic cluster name: DockerCluster Domain UID: domain1   #!/bin/sh # Setup properties ophost=`uname -n` opport=31001 #externalRestHttpsPort cluster=cluster-1 size=3 #New cluster size ns=weblogic-operator # Operator NameSpace sa=weblogic-operator # Operator ServiceAccount domainuid=domain1 # Retrieve service account name for given namespace sec=`kubectl get serviceaccount ${sa} -n ${ns} -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}'` #echo \u0026quot;Secret [${sec}]\u0026quot; # Retrieve base64 encoded secret for the given service account enc_token=`kubectl get secret ${sec} -n ${ns} -o jsonpath='{.data.token}'` #echo \u0026quot;enc_token [${enc_token}]\u0026quot; # Decode the base64 encoded token token=`echo ${enc_token} | base64 --decode` #echo \u0026quot;token [${token}]\u0026quot; # clean up any temporary files rm -rf operator.rest.response.body operator.rest.stderr operator.cert.pem # Retrieve SSL certificate from the Operator's external REST endpoint `openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ${ophost}:${opport} \u0026lt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM \u0026gt; operator.cert.pem` echo \u0026quot;Rest EndPoint url https://${ophost}:${opport}/operator/v1/domains/${domainuid}/clusters/${cluster}/scale\u0026quot; # Issue 'curl' request to external REST endpoint curl --noproxy '*' -v --cacert operator.cert.pem \\ -H \u0026quot;Authorization: Bearer ${token}\u0026quot; \\ -H Accept:application/json \\ -H \u0026quot;Content-Type:application/json\u0026quot; \\ -H \u0026quot;X-Requested-By:WLDF\u0026quot; \\ -d \u0026quot;{\\\u0026quot;managedServerCount\\\u0026quot;: $size}\u0026quot; \\ -X POST https://${ophost}:${opport}/operator/v1/domains/${domainuid}/clusters/${cluster}/scale \\ -o operator.rest.response.body \\ --stderr operator.rest.stderr  "

	"description": "",
	"content": " This document outlines how to set up a Kubernetes persistent volume and persistent volume claim which can be used as storage for WebLogic domain homes and log files. A persistent volume can be shared by multiple WebLogic domains or dedicated to a particular domain.\nPrerequisites The following prerequisites must be fulfilled before proceeding with the creation of the volume:\n Create a Kubernetes namespace for the persistent volume claim unless the intention is to use the default namespace. Note that a persistent volume claim has to be in the same namespace as the domain resource that uses it. Make sure that all the servers in the WebLogic domain are able to reach the storage location. Make sure that the host directory that will be used, already exists and has the appropriate file permissions set.  Storage locations Persistent volumes can point to different storage locations, for example NFS servers or a local directory path. The list of available options is listed in the Kubernetes documentation.\nNote regarding HostPath: In a single-node Kubernetes cluster, such as may be used for testing or proof of concept activities, HOST_PATH provides the simplest configuration. In a multinode Kubernetes cluster, a HOST_PATH that is located on shared storage mounted by all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster is the simplest configuration. If nodes do not have shared storage, then NFS is probably the most widely available option. There are other options listed in the referenced table.\nThe persistent volume for the domain must be created using the appropriate tools before running the script to create the domain. In the simplest case, namely the HOST_PATH provider, this means creating a directory on the Kubernetes master and ensuring that it has the correct permissions:\n$ mkdir -m 777 -p /path/to/domain1PersistentVolume  Note regarding NFS: In the current GA version, the OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes supports network block storage that can be shared across nodes with access permission RWOnce (meaning that only one can write, others can read only). At this time, the WebLogic on Kubernetes domain created by the WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator, requires a shared file system to store the WebLogic domain configuration, which MUST be accessible from all the pods across the nodes. As a workaround, you need to install an NFS server on one node and share the file system across all the nodes.\nCurrently, we recommend that you use NFS version 3.0 for running WebLogic Server on OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes. During certification, we found that when using NFS 4.0, the servers in the WebLogic domain went into a failed state intermittently. Because multiple threads use NFS (default store, diagnostics store, Node Manager, logging, and domain_home), there are issues when accessing the file store. These issues are removed by changing the NFS to version 3.0.\nYAML files Persistent volumes and claims are described in YAML files. For each persistent volume, you should create one persistent volume YAML file and one persistent volume claim YAML file. In the example below, you will find two YAML templates, one for the volume and one for the claim. As stated above, they either can be dedicated to a specific domain, or shared across multiple domains. For the use cases where a volume will be dedicated to a particular domain, it is a best practice to label it with weblogic.domainUID=[domain name]. This makes it easy to search for, and clean up resources associated with that particular domain.\nFor sample YAML templates, refer to the Persistent volumes example.\nKubernetes resources After you have written your YAML files, use them to create the persistent volume by creating Kubernetes resources using the kubectl create -f command:\n$ kubectl create -f pv.yaml $ kubectl create -f pvc.yaml  Verify the results To confirm that the persistent volume was created, use these commands:\n$ kubectl describe pv [persistent volume name] $ kubectl describe pvc -n NAMESPACE [persistent volume claim name]  Common problems This section provides details of common problems that might occur while running the script and how to resolve them.\nPersistent volume provider not configured correctly Possibly the most common problem experienced during testing was the incorrect configuration of the persistent volume provider. The persistent volume must be accessible to all Kubernetes nodes, and must be able to be mounted as Read/Write/Many. If this is not the case, the persistent volume creation will fail.\nThe simplest case is where the HOST_PATH provider is used. This can be either with one Kubernetes node, or with the HOST_PATH residing in shared storage available at the same location on every node (for example, on an NFS mount). In this case, the path used for the persistent volume must have its permission bits set to 777.\nFurther reading  See the blog, How to run WebLogic clusters on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes.

	"description": "Helm is used to create and deploy necessary operator resources and to run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. Use the operator&#39;s Helm chart to install and manage the operator.",
	"content": " Overview Helm is a framework that helps you manage Kubernetes applications, and Helm charts help you define and install Helm applications into a Kubernetes cluster. The operator\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart is located in the kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator directory.\nImportant note for users of operator releases before 2.0   Click here to expand   If you have an older version of the operator installed on your cluster, for example, a 1.x version or one of the 2.0 release candidates, then you must remove it before installing this version. This includes the 2.0-rc1 version; it must be completely removed. You should remove the deployment (for example, kubectl delete deploy weblogic-operator -n your-namespace) and the custom resource definition (for example, kubectl delete crd domain). If you do not remove the custom resource definition, then you might see errors like this:\nError from server (BadRequest): error when creating \u0026quot;/scratch/output/uidomain/weblogic-domains/uidomain/domain.yaml\u0026quot;: the API version in the data (weblogic.oracle/v2) does not match the expected API version (weblogic.oracle/v1    \nInstall Helm and Tiller Helm has two parts: a client (Helm) and a server (Tiller). Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster, and manages releases (installations) of your charts. See https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md for detailed instructions on installing Helm and Tiller.\nIn order to use Helm to install and manage the operator, you need to ensure that the service account that Tiller uses has the cluster-admin role. The default would be default in namespace kube-system. You can give that service account the necessary permissions with this command:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: helm-user-cluster-admin-role roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default namespace: kube-system EOF  Oracle strongly recommends that you create a new service account to be used exclusively by Tiller and grant cluster-admin to that service account, rather than using the default one.\n Operator\u0026rsquo;s Helm Chart Configuration The operator Helm chart is pre-configured with default values for the configuration of the operator.\nYou can override these values by doing one of the following:\n Creating a custom YAML file with only the values to be overridden, and specifying the --value option on the Helm command line. Overriding individual values directly on the Helm command line, using the --set option.  You can find out the configuration values that the Helm chart supports, as well as the default values, using this command:\n$ helm inspect values kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator  The available configuration values are explained by category in Operator Helm configuration values.\nHelm commands are explained in more detail in Useful Helm operations.\nOptional: Configure the operator\u0026rsquo;s external REST HTTPS interface The operator can expose an external REST HTTPS interface which can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster. As with the operator\u0026rsquo;s internal REST interface, the external REST interface requires an SSL/TLS certificate and private key that the operator will use as the identity of the external REST interface (see below).\nTo enable the external REST interface, configure these values in a custom configuration file, or on the Helm command line:\n Set externalRestEnabled to true. Set externalRestIdentitySecret to the name of the kubernetes tls secret that contains the certificate(s) and private key. Optionally, set externalRestHttpsPort to the external port number for the operator REST interface (defaults to 31001).  For more detailed information, see the REST interface configuration values.\nSample SSL certificate and private key for the REST interface For testing purposes, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator project provides a sample script that generates a self-signed certificate and private key for the operator external REST interface. The generated certificate and key is stored in a Kubernetes tls secret and the sample script outputs the corresponding configuration values in YAML format. These values can be added to your custom YAML configuration file, for use when the operator\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart is installed.\nThe sample script should not be used in a production environment because typically a self-signed certificate for external communucation is not considered safe. A certficate signed by a commercial certificate authority is more widely accepted and should contain valid host names, expiration dates and key constraints.\n For more detailed information about the sample script and how to run it, see the REST APIs in the Samples section.\nOptional: Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) integration The operator Helm chart includes the option of installing the necessary Kubernetes resources for Elastic Stack integration.\nYou are responsible for configuring Kibana and Elasticsearch, then configuring the operator Helm chart to send events to Elasticsearch. In turn, the operator Helm chart configures Logstash in the operator deployment to send the operator\u0026rsquo;s log contents to that Elasticsearch location.\nElastic Stack per-operator configuration As part of the Elastic Stack integration, Logstash configuration occurs for each deployed operator instance. You can use the following configuration values to configure the integration:\n Set elkIntegrationEnabled is true to enable the integration. Set logStashImage to override the default version of Logstash to be used (logstash:6.2). Set elasticSearchHost and elasticSearchPort to override the default location where Elasticsearch is running (elasticsearch2.default.svc.cluster.local:9201). This will configure Logstash to send the operator\u0026rsquo;s log contents there.  For more detailed information, see the Operator Helm configuration values.\n"

	"content": "The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator (the “operator”) is designed to fulfill a similar role to that which a human operator would fill in a traditional data center deployment. It contains a set of useful built-in knowledge about how to perform various life cycle operations on a domain correctly.\nHuman operators are normally responsible for starting and stopping environments, initiating backups, performing scaling operations, performing manual tasks associated with disaster recovery and high availability needs and coordinating actions with other operators in other data centers. It is envisaged that the operator will have similar responsibilities in a Kubernetes environment.\nIt is important to note the distinction between an operator and an administrator. A WebLogic Server administrator typically has different responsibilities centered around managing the detailed configuration of the WebLogic domains. The operator has only limited interest in the domain configuration, with its main concern being the high-level topology of the domain; for example, how many clusters and servers, and information about network access points, such as channels.\nHuman operators may manage more than one domain, and the operator is also designed to be able to manage more than one domain. Like its human counterpart, the operator will only take actions against domains that it is told to manage, and will ignore any other domains that may be present in the same environment.\nLike a human operator, the operator is designed to be event-based. It waits for a significant event to occur, or for a scheduled time to perform some action, and then takes the appropriate action. Examples of significant events include being made aware of a new domain that needs to be managed, receiving a request to scale up a WebLogic cluster, or receiving a request to perform a backup of a domain.\nThe operator is designed with security in mind from the outset. Some examples of the specific security practices we follow are:\n During the deployment of the operator, Kubernetes roles are defined and assigned to the operator. These roles are designed to give the operator the minimum amount of privileges that it requires to perform its tasks. The code base is regularly scanned with security auditing tools and any issues that are identified are promptly resolved. All HTTP communications – between the operator and an external client, between the operator and WebLogic Administration Servers, and so on – are configured to require SSL and TLS 1.2. Unused code is pruned from the code base regularly. Dependencies are kept as up-to-date as possible and are regularly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.  The operator is designed to avoid imposing any arbitrary restriction on how WebLogic Server may be configured or used in Kubernetes. Where there are restrictions, these are based on the availability of some specific feature in Kubernetes; for example, multicast support.\nThe operator learns of WebLogic domains through instances of a domain Kubernetes resource. When the operator is installed, it creates a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition. This custom resource definition defines the domain resource type. After this type is defined, you can manage domain resources using kubectl just like any other resource type. For instance, kubectl get domain or kubectl edit domain domain1.\nSchema for domain resources is here.\nThe schema for the domain resource is designed to be as sparse as possible. It includes the connection details for the Administration Server, but all of the other content is operational details about which servers should be started, environment variables, and details about what should be exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. This way, the WebLogic domain\u0026rsquo;s configuration remains the normative configuration.\n"

If a domain resource domainHome field is not set and domainHomeInImage is true (the default), then the operator will assume that the domain home is a directory under /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/ and report an error if no domain is found or more than one domain is found. If a domain resource domainHome field is not set and domainHomeInImage is false, then the operator will assume that the domain home is /shared/domains/DOMAIN_UID. Oracle strongly recommends storing an image containing a WebLogic domain home as private in the registry (for example, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry, Docker Hub, and such). A Docker image that contains a WebLogic domain has sensitive information including keys and credentials that are used access external resources (for example, data source password). For more information, see domain home in image protection in the Security section.\n  Log File Locations: The operator can automatically override WebLogic domain and server log locations using situational configuration overrides. This occurs if the domain resource logHomeEnabled field is explicitly set to true, or if logHomeEnabled isn\u0026rsquo;t set and domainHomeInImage is explicitly set to false. When overriding, the log location will be the location specified by the logHome setting.\n Listen Address Overrides: The operator will automatically override all WebLogic domain default, SSL, admin, or custom channel listen addresses (using situational configuration overrides). These will become domainUID followed by a hyphen and then the server name, all lower case, and underscores converted to hyphens. For example, if domainUID=domain1 and the WebLogic server name is Admin_Server, then its listen address becomes domain1-admin-server.\n Domain, Cluster, Server, and Network-Access-Point Names: WebLogic domain, cluster, server, and network-access-point (channel) names must contain only the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, or _. This ensures that they can be converted to meet Kubernetes resource and DNS1123 naming requirements. (When generating pod and service names, the operator will convert configured names to lower case and substitute a hyphen (-) for each underscore (_).)\n Node Ports: If you choose to expose any WebLogic channels outside the Kubernetes cluster via a NodePort, for example, the administration port or a T3 channel to allow WLST access, you need to ensure that you allocate each channel a unique port number across the entire Kubernetes cluster. If you expose the administration port in each WebLogic domain in the Kubernetes cluster, then each one must have a different port. This is required because NodePorts are used to expose channels outside the Kubernetes cluster.\nExposing admin, RMI, or T3 capable channels via a Kubernetes NodePort can create an insecure configuration. In general, only HTTP protocols should be made available externally and this exposure is usually accomplished by setting up an external load balancer that can access internal (non-NodePort) services. For more information, see T3 channels in the Security section.\n  Host Path Persistent Volumes: If using a hostPath persistent volume, then it must be available on all worker nodes in the cluster and have read/write/many permissions for all container/pods in the WebLogic Server deployment. Be aware that many cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s volume providers may not support volumes across availability zones. You may want to use NFS or a clustered file system to work around this limitation.\n Security Note: The USER_MEM_ARGS environment variable defaults to -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom in all WebLogic Server pods and the WebLogic introspection job. It can be explicitly set to another value in your domain resource YAML file using the env attribute under the serverPod configuration.\n  The following features are not certified or supported in this release:\n Whole server migration Consensus leasing Node Manager (although it is used internally for the liveness probe and to start WebLogic Server instances) Multicast Multitenancy Production redeployment  Please consult My Oracle Support Doc ID 2349228.1 for up-to-date information about the features of WebLogic Server that are supported in Kubernetes environments.\nCreating and managing WebLogic domains You can locate a WebLogic domain either in a persistent volume (PV) or in a Docker image. For examples of each, see the WebLogic operator samples.\nIf you want to create your own Docker images, for example, to choose a specific set of patches or to create a domain with a specific configuration and/or applications deployed, then you can create the domain custom resource manually to deploy your domain. This process is documented in this sample.\nModifying domain configurations You can modify the WebLogic domain configuration for both the \u0026ldquo;domain in persistent volume\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;domain in image\u0026rdquo; options before deploying a domain resource:\n When the domain is in a persistent volume, you can use WLST or WDT to change the configuration. For either case, you can use configuration overrides.\n  Configuration overrides allow changing a configuration without modifying its original config.xml or system resource XML files, and also support parameterizing overrides so that you can inject values into them from Kubernetes secrets. For example, you can inject database user names, passwords, and URLs that are stored in a secret.\nAbout the domain resource For information about the domain resource, see Domain resource.\nManaging life cycle operations You can perform life cycle operations on WebLogic servers, clusters, or domains. See Starting, stopping, and restarting servers and Restarting WebLogic servers.\nScaling clusters The operator let\u0026rsquo;s you initiate scaling of clusters in various ways:\n Using kubectl to edit the domain resource Using the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST APIs Using WLDF policies Using a Prometheus action  "

The operator will also attempt to verify that the RBAC settings are correct when the operator starts running.\nFor more information about the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the operator, see Service Accounts under Security.\n The general design goal is to provide the operator with the minimum amount of permissions that the operator requires and to favor built-in roles over custom roles where it make sense to use the Kubernetes built-in roles.\nFor more information about Kubernetes roles, see the Kubernetes RBAC documentation.\n Operator RBAC definitions To display the Kubernetes roles and related bindings used by the WebLogic operator where the operator was installed using the Helm release name weblogic-operator, look for the Kubernetes objects:\n Role RoleBinding ClusterRole ClusterRoleBinding  when using the Helm status command:\n$ helm status weblogic-operator  Assuming the operator was installed into the namespace weblogic-operator-ns with a target namespaces of domain1-ns, the following commands can be used to display a subset of the Kubernetes roles and related role bindings:\n$ kubectl describe clusterrole \\ weblogic-operator-ns-weblogic-operator-clusterrole-general $ kubectl describe clusterrolebinding \\ weblogic-operator-ns-weblogic-operator-clusterrolebinding-general $ kubectl -n weblogic-operator-ns \\ describe role weblogic-operator-role $ kubectl -n domain1-ns \\ describe rolebinding weblogic-operator-rolebinding-namespace \\  Kubernetes role and role binding naming convention The following naming pattern is used for the Role and RoleBinding objects:\n weblogic-operator-\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;optional-role-name\u0026gt;  Using:\n \u0026lt;type\u0026gt; as the kind of Kubernetes object:  role rolebinding  \u0026lt;optional-role-name\u0026gt; as an optional name given to the role or role binding  For example: namespace   A complete name for an operator created Kubernetes RoleBinding would be:\n weblogic-operator-rolebinding-namespace\n Kubernetes cluster role and cluster role binding naming convention The following naming pattern is used for the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding objects:\n \u0026lt;operator-ns\u0026gt;-weblogic-operator-\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt;  Using:\n \u0026lt;operator-ns\u0026gt; as the namespace the operator is installed in  For example: weblogic-operator-ns  \u0026lt;type\u0026gt; as the kind of Kubernetes object:  clusterrole clusterrolebinding  \u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt; as the name given to the role or role binding  For example: general   A complete name for an operator created Kubernetes ClusterRoleBinding would be:\n weblogic-operator-ns-weblogic-operator-clusterrolebinding-general\n Role bindings Assuming that the WebLogic operator was installed into the Kubernetes namespace weblogic-operator-ns, and a target namespace for the operator is domain1-ns, the following RoleBinding entries are mapped to a Role or ClusterRole granting permission to the operator.\n   Role Binding Mapped to Role Resource Access Notes     weblogic-operator-rolebinding weblogic-operator-role Edit: secrets, configmaps, events The role binding is created in the namespace weblogic-operator-ns 1   weblogic-operator-rolebinding-namespace Operator Cluster Role namespace Read: secrets, pod/log, storageclasses The role binding is created in the namespace domain1-ns 2     Edit: configmaps, events, pods, podtemplates, services, persistentvolumeclaims, newtworkpolicies, podsecuritypolicies, podpresets, jobs.batch, cronjobs.batch      Create: pods/exec     Cluster role bindings Assuming that the WebLogic operator was installed into the Kubernetes namespace weblogic-operator-ns, the following ClusterRoleBinding entries are mapped to a ClusterRole granting permission to the operator.\nNote: The Operator names in table below represent the \u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt; from cluster names section.\n   Cluster Role Binding Mapped to Cluster Role Resource Access Notes     Operator general Operator general Read: namespaces 1     Edit: customresourcedefinitions, ingresses, persistentvolumes      Update: domains (weblogic.oracle), domains/status      Create: tokenreviews, subjectaccessreviews, localsubjectaccessreviews, selfsubjectaccessreviews, selfsubjectrulesreviews    Operator nonresource Operator nonresource Get: /version/* 1   Operator discovery Kubernetes system:discovery See: Kubernetes Discovery Roles 1   Operator auth-delegator Kubernetes system:auth-delegator See: Kubernetes Component Roles 1     The binding is assigned to the operator ServiceAccount.

	"content": " Contents  Overview Prerequisites Typical overrides Unsupported overrides Override template names and syntax  Override template names Override template schemas Override template macros Override template syntax special requirements Override template samples  Step-by-step guide Debugging Internal design flow  Overview Use configuration overrides (also called situational configuration) to customize a WebLogic domain home configuration without modifying the domain\u0026rsquo;s actual config.xml or system resource files. For example, you may want to override a JDBC data source XML module user name, password, and URL so that it references a local database.\nYou can use overrides to customize domains as they are moved from QA to production, are deployed to different sites, or are even deployed multiple times at the same site.\nHow do you specify overrides?  Make sure your domain home meets the prerequisites. See Prerequisites. Make sure your overrides are supported. See Typical overrides and Unsupported overrides. Create a Kubernetes configuration map that contains:  Override templates (also known as situational configuration templates), with names and syntax as described in Override template names and syntax. A file named version.txt that contains the exact string 2.0.  Set your domain resource configOverrides to the name of this configuration map. If templates leverage secret macros:  Create Kubernetes secrets that contain template macro values. Set your domain configOverrideSecrets to reference the aforementioned secrets.  Stop all running WebLogic Server pods in your domain. (See Starting and stopping servers.) Start or restart your domain. (See Starting and stopping servers and Restarting servers.) Verify your overrides are taking effect. (See Debugging).  For a detailed walk-through of these steps, see the Step-by-step guide.\nHow do overrides work during runtime?  When a domain is first deployed, or is restarted after shutting down all the WebLogic Server pods, the operator will:  Resolve any macros in your override templates. Place expanded override templates in the optconfig directory located in each WebLogic domain home directory.\n  When the WebLogic Servers start, they will:  Automatically load the override files from the optconfig directory. Use the override values in the override files instead of the values specified in their config.xml or system resource XML files.   For a detailed walk-through of the runtime flow, see the Internal design flow.\nPrerequisites  A WebLogic domain home must not contain any situational configuration XML file in its optconfig directory that was not placed there by the operator. Any existing situational configuration XML files in this directory will be deleted and replaced by your operator override templates (if any).\n If you want to override a JDBC, JMS, or WLDF (diagnostics) module, the original module must be located in your domain home config/jdbc, config/jms, and config/diagnostics directory, respectively. These are the default locations for these types of modules.\n  Typical overrides Typical attributes for overrides include:\n User names, passwords, and URLs for:  JDBC datasources JMS bridges, foreign servers, and SAF  Network channel public addresses:  For remote RMI clients (T3, JMS, EJB, JTA) For remote WLST clients  Debugging Tuning (MaxMessageSize, etc.)  Unsupported overrides IMPORTANT: The operator does not support custom overrides in the following areas.\n Domain topology (cluster members) Network channel listen address, port, and enabled configuration Server and domain log locations Node Manager related configuration Changing any existing MBean name  Specifically, do not use custom overrides for:\n Adding or removing:  Servers Clusters Network Access Points (custom channels)  Changing any of the following:  Dynamic cluster size Default, SSL, and Admin channel Enabled, listen address, and port Network Access Point (custom channel), listen address, or port Server and domain log locations \u0026ndash; use the logHome domain setting instead Node Manager access credentials Any existing MBean name (for example, you cannot change the domain name)   Note that it\u0026rsquo;s OK, even expected, to override Network Access Point public or external addresses and ports.\nThe behavior when using an unsupported override is undefined.\nOverride template names and syntax Overrides leverage a built-in WebLogic feature called \u0026ldquo;Configuration Overriding\u0026rdquo; which is often informally called \u0026ldquo;Situational Configuration.\u0026rdquo; Situational configuration consists of XML formatted files that closely resemble the structure of WebLogic config.xml and system resource module XML files. In addition, the attribute fields in these files can embed add, replace, and delete verbs to specify the desired override action for the field.\nOverride template names The operator requires a different file name format for override templates than WebLogic\u0026rsquo;s built-in situational configuration feature. It converts the names to the format required by situational configuration when it moves the templates to the domain home optconfig directory. The following table describes the format:\n   Original Configuration Required Override Name     config.xml config.xml   JMS module jms-MODULENAME.xml   JDBC module jdbc-MODULENAME.xml   Diagnostics module diagnostics-MODULENAME.xml    A MODULENAME must correspond to the MBean name of a system resource defined in your original config.xml file.\nOverride template schemas An override template must define the exact schemas required by the situational configuration feature. The schemas vary based on the file type you wish to override.\nconfig.xml\n\u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:domain xmlns:d=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/domain\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/domain-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/d:domain\u0026gt;  jdbc-MODULENAME.xml\n\u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:jdbc-data-source xmlns:jdbc=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/jdbc-data-source\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/jdbc-data-source-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/jdbc:jdbc-data-source\u0026gt;  jms-MODULENAME.xml\n\u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jms:weblogic-jms xmlns:jms=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-jms\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-jms-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot; \u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/jms:weblogic-jms\u0026gt;  diagnostics-MODULENAME.xml\n\u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;wldf:wldf-resource xmlns:wldf=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-diagnostics\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-diagnostics-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot; \u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/wldf:wldf-resource\u0026gt;  Override template macros The operator supports embedding macros within override templates. This helps make your templates flexibly handle multiple use cases, such as specifying a different URL, user name, and password for a different deployment.\nTwo types of macros are supported, environment variable macros and secret macros:\n Environment variable macros have the syntax ${env:ENV-VAR-NAME}, where the supported environment variables include DOMAIN_UID, DOMAIN_NAME, DOMAIN_HOME, and LOG_HOME.\n Secret macros have the syntax ${secret:SECRETNAME.SECRETKEY} and ${secret:SECRETNAME.SECRETKEY:encrypt}.\n  The secret macro SECRETNAME field must reference the name of a Kubernetes secret, and the SECRETKEY field must reference a key within that secret. For example, if you have created a secret named dbuser with a key named username that contains the value scott, then the macro ${secret:dbuser.username} will be replaced with the word scott before the template is copied into its WebLogic Server pod.\nSECURITY NOTE: Use the :encrypt suffix in a secret macro to encrypt its replacement value with the WebLogic WLST encrypt command (instead of leaving it at its plain text value). This is useful for overriding MBean attributes that expect encrypted values, such as the password-encrypted field of a data source, and is also useful for ensuring that a custom override situational configuration file the operator places in the domain home does not expose passwords in plain-text.\nOverride template syntax special requirements Check each item below to ensure custom situational configuration takes effect:\n Reference the name of the current bean and each parent bean in any hierarchy you override.  See Override template samples for examples.  Use situational config replace and add verbs as follows:  If you are adding a new bean that doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist in your original domain home config.xml, specify add on the MBean itself and on each attribute within the bean. See the server-debug stanza in Override template samples for an example. If you are adding a new attribute to an existing bean in the domain home config.xml, the attribute needs an add verb. See the max-message-size stanza in Override template samples for an example. If you are changing the value of an existing attribute within a domain home config.xml, the attribute needs a replace verb. See the public-address stanza in Override template samples for an example.  When overriding config.xml:  The XML namespace (xmlns: in the XML) must be exactly as specified in Override template schemas. For example, use d: to reference config.xml beans and attributes, f: for add and replace domain-fragment verbs, and s: to reference the situational configuration schema. Avoid specifying the domain name stanza, as this may cause some overrides to be ignored (for example, server-template scoped overrides).  When overriding modules:  It is a best practice to use XML namespace abbreviations jms:, jdbc:, and wldf: respectively for JMS, JDBC, and WLDF (diagnostics) module override files.   Override template samples Here are some sample template override files.\nOverriding config.xml The following config.xml override file demonstrates:\n Setting the max-message-size field on a WebLogic Server named admin-server. It assumes the original config.xml does not define this value, and so uses add instead of replace. Sets the public-address and public-port fields with values obtained from a secret named test-host with keys hostname and port. It assumes the original config.xml already sets these fields, and so uses replace instead of add. Sets two debug settings. It assumes the original config.xml does not have a server-debug stanza, so it uses add throughout the entire stanza.  \u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:domain xmlns:d=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/domain\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/domain-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:name\u0026gt;admin-server\u0026lt;/d:name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:max-message-size f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;add\u0026quot;\u0026gt;78787878\u0026lt;/d:max-message-size\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:server-debug f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;add\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:debug-server-life-cycle f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;add\u0026quot;\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/d:debug-server-life-cycle\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:debug-jmx-core f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;add\u0026quot;\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/d:debug-jmx-core\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:server-debug\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:network-access-point\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:name\u0026gt;T3Channel\u0026lt;/d:name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:public-address f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;replace\u0026quot;\u0026gt;${secret:test-host.hostname}\u0026lt;/d:public-address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:public-port f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;replace\u0026quot;\u0026gt;${secret:test-host.port}\u0026lt;/d:public-port\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:network-access-point\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:domain\u0026gt;  Overriding a data source module The following jdbc-testDS.xml override template demonstrates setting the URL, user name, and password-encrypted fields of a JDBC module named testDS via secret macros. The generated situational configuration that replaces the macros with secret values will be located in the DOMAIN_HOME/optconfig/jdbc directory. The password-encrypted field will be populated with an encrypted value because it uses a secret macro with an :encrypt suffix. The secret is named dbsecret and contains three keys: url, username, and password.\n\u0026lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:jdbc-data-source xmlns:jdbc=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/jdbc-data-source\u0026quot; xmlns:f=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/jdbc-data-source-fragment\u0026quot; xmlns:s=\u0026quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/situational-config\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:name\u0026gt;testDS\u0026lt;/jdbc:name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:jdbc-driver-params\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:url f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;replace\u0026quot;\u0026gt;${secret:dbsecret.url}\u0026lt;/jdbc:url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:properties\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:name\u0026gt;user\u0026lt;/jdbc:name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:value f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;replace\u0026quot;\u0026gt;${secret:dbsecret.username}\u0026lt;/jdbc:value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/jdbc:property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/jdbc:properties\u0026gt; \u0026lt;jdbc:password-encrypted f:combine-mode=\u0026quot;replace\u0026quot;\u0026gt;${secret:dbsecret.password:encrypt}\u0026lt;/jdbc:password-encrypted\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/jdbc:jdbc-driver-params\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/jdbc:jdbc-data-source\u0026gt;  Step-by-step guide  Make sure your domain home meets the prerequisites. See Prerequisites. Make sure your overrides are supported. See Typical overrides and Unsupported overrides. Create a directory containing (A) a set of situational configuration templates for overriding the MBean properties you want to replace and (B) a version.txt file.  This directory must not contain any other files. The version.txt file must contain exactly the string 2.0. Note: This version.txt file must stay 2.0 even when you are updating your templates from a previous deployment. Templates must not override the settings listed in Unsupported overrides. Templates must be formatted and named as per Override template names and syntax. Templates can embed macros that reference environment variables or Kubernetes secrets. See Override template macros.  Create a Kubernetes configuration map from the directory of templates.  The configuration map must be in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain. If the configuration map is going to be used by a single DOMAIN_UID, we recommend adding the weblogic.domainUID=\u0026lt;mydomainuid\u0026gt; label to help track the resource. For example, assuming ./mydir contains your version.txt and situation configuration template files:  kubectl -n MYNAMESPACE create cm MYCMNAME --from-file ./mydir kubectl -n MYNAMESPACE label cm MYCMNAME weblogic.domainUID=DOMAIN_UID   Create any Kubernetes secrets referenced by a template \u0026lsquo;secret macro\u0026rsquo;.  Secrets can have multiple keys (files) that can hold either cleartext or base64 values. We recommend that you use base64 values for passwords via Opaque type secrets in their data field, so that they can\u0026rsquo;t be easily read at a casual glance. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/. Secrets must be in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain. If a secret is going to be used by a single DOMAIN_UID, we recommend adding the weblogic.domainUID=\u0026lt;mydomainuid\u0026gt; label to help track the resource. For example:  kubectl -n MYNAMESPACE create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key1=supersecret --from-literal=key2=topsecret kubectl -n MYNAMESPACE label secret my-secret weblogic.domainUID=DOMAIN_UID   Configure the name of the configuration map in the domain CR configOverrides field. Configure the names of each secret in domain CR.  If the secret contains the WebLogic admin username and password keys, set the domain CR webLogicCredentialsSecret field. For all other secrets, add them to the domain CR configOverrideSecrets field. Note: This must be in an array format even if you only add one secret (see the sample domain resource YAML below).  Any override changes require stopping all WebLogic pods, applying your domain resource (if it changed), and restarting the WebLogic pods before they can take effect.  Custom override changes on an existing running domain, such as updating an override configuration map, a secret, or a domain resource, will not take effect until all running WebLogic Server pods in your domain are shutdown (so no servers are left running), and the domain is subsequently restarted with your new domain resource (if it changed), or with your existing domain resource (if you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed it). To stop all running WebLogic Server pods in your domain, apply a changed resource, and then start/restart the domain: Set your domain resource serverStartPolicy to NEVER, wait, and apply your latest domain resource with the serverStartPolicy restored back to ALWAYS or IF_NEEDED (See Starting and stopping servers.) Or delete your domain resource, wait, and apply your (potentially changed) domain resource.  See Debugging for ways to check if the situational configuration is taking effect or if there are errors.  Example domain resource YAML:\napiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v2\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: domain1 namespace: default labels: weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2 weblogic.domainUID: domain1 spec: [ ... ] webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: domain1-wl-credentials-secret configOverrides: domain1-overrides-config-map configOverrideSecrets: [my-secret, my-other-secret] [ ... ]  Debugging Incorrectly formatted override files may be accepted without warnings or errors, and will not prevent WebLogic pods from booting. So it is important to make sure that the template files are correct in a QA environment, otherwise your WebLogic Servers may start even though critically required overrides are failing to take effect.\n Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve followed each step in the Step-by-step guide.\n If WebLogic pods do not come up at all, then:\n In the domain\u0026rsquo;s namespace, see if you can find a job named DOMAIN_UID-introspect-domain-job and a corresponding pod named something like DOMAIN_UID-introspect-domain-job-xxxx. If so, examine: kubectl -n MYDOMAINNAMESPACE describe job INTROSPECTJOBNAME kubectl -n MYDOMAINNAMESPACE logs INTROSPECTPODNAME Check your operator log for Warning/Error/Severe messages. kubectl -n MYOPERATORNAMESPACE logs OPERATORPODNAME  If WebLogic pods do start, then:\n Search your Administration Server pod\u0026rsquo;s kubectl log for the keyword situational, for example kubectl logs MYADMINPOD | grep -i situational. The only WebLogic Server log lines that match should look something like like:  \u0026lt;Dec 14, 2018 12:20:47 PM UTC\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Info\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Management\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BEA-141330\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Loading situational configuration file: /shared/domains/domain1/optconfig/custom-situational-config.xml\u0026gt; This line indicates a situational configuration file has been loaded.  If the search yields Warning or Error lines, then the format of the custom situational configuration template is incorrect, and the Warning or Error text should describe the problem. Note: The following exception may show up in your server logs when overriding JDBC modules. It is not expected to affect runtime behavior, and can be ignored (a fix is pending for them):  java.lang.NullPointerException at weblogic.management.provider.internal.situationalconfig.SituationalConfigManagerImpl.registerListener(SituationalConfigManagerImpl.java:227) at weblogic.management.provider.internal.situationalconfig.SituationalConfigManagerImpl.start(SituationalConfigManagerImpl.java:319) ... at weblogic.management.configuration.DomainMBeanImpl.setJDBCSystemResources(DomainMBeanImpl.java:11444) ...  Look in your DOMAIN_HOME/optconfig directory. This directory, or a subdirectory within this directory, should contain each of your custom situational configuration files. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, this likely indicates your domain resource configOverrides was not set to match your custom override configuration map name, or that your custom override configuration map does not contain your override files.  If you\u0026rsquo;d like to verify that the situational configuration is taking effect in the WebLogic MBean tree, one way to do this is to compare the server config and domain config MBean tree values.\n The domain config value should reflect the original value in your domain home configuration. The server config value should reflect the overridden value. For example, assuming your DOMAIN_UID is domain1, and your domain contains a WebLogic Server named admin-server, then:    kubectl exec -it domain1-admin-server /bin/bash $ wlst.sh \u0026gt; connect(MYADMINUSERNAME, MYADMINPASSWORD, 't3://domain1-admin-server:7001') \u0026gt; domainConfig() \u0026gt; get('/Servers/admin-server/MaxMessageSize') \u0026gt; serverConfig() \u0026gt; get('/Servers/admin-server/MaxMessageSize') \u0026gt; exit()   To cause the WebLogic situational configuration feature to produce additional debugging information in the WebLogic Server logs, configure the JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable in your domain resource with:\n-Dweblogic.debug.DebugSituationalConfig=true -Dweblogic.debug.DebugSituationalConfigDumpXml=true  NOTE: The WebLogic console will not reflect any override changes. You cannot use the console to verify overrides are taking effect.\n  Internal design flow  When a domain is first deployed, or is restarted, the operator runtime creates an introspector Kubernetes job named DOMAIN_UID-introspect-domain-job. The introspector job\u0026rsquo;s pod:  Mounts the Kubernetes configuration map and secrets specified via the operator domain resource configOverrides, webLogicCredentialsSecret, and configOverrideSecrets fields. Reads the mounted situational configuration templates from the configuration map and expands them to create the actual situational configuration files for the domain: It expands some fixed replaceable values (e.g. ${env:DOMAIN_UID}). It expands referenced secrets by reading the value from the corresponding mounted secret file (e.g. ${secret:mysecret.mykey}). It optionally encrypts secrets using offline WLST to encrypt the value - useful for passwords (e.g. ${secret:mysecret.mykey:encrypt}). It returns expanded situational configuration files to the operator. It reports any errors when attempting expansion to the operator.  The operator runtime:  Reads the expanded situational configuration files and/or errors from the introspector. And, if the introspector reported no errors, it: Puts situational configuration files in a configuration map named DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm. Mounts this configuration map into the WebLogic Server pods. Starts the WebLogic Server pods. Otherwise, if the introspector reported errors, it: Logs warning, error, or severe messages. Will not start WebLogic Server pods.  The startServer.sh script in the WebLogic Server pods:  Copies the expanded situational configuration files to a special location where the WebLogic runtime can find them: config.xml overrides are copied to the optconfig directory in its domain home. Module overrides are copied to the optconfig/jdbc, optconfig/jms, or optconfig/diagnostics directory. Deletes any situational configuration files in the optconfig directory that do not have corresponding template files in the configuration map.  WebLogic Servers read their overrides from their domain home\u0026rsquo;s optconfig directory.  "

	"content": " Ingresses are one approach provided by Kubernetes to configure load balancers. Depending on the version of Kubernetes you are using, and your cloud provider, you may need to use Ingresses. Please refer to the Ingress documentation for more information about Ingresses.\nWebLogic clusters as backends of an Ingress In an Ingress object, a list of backends are provided for each target that will be load balanced. Each backend is typically a Kubernetes service, more specifically, a combination of a serviceName and a servicePort.\nWhen the WebLogic operator creates a WebLogic domain, it also creates a service for each WebLogic cluster in the domain. The operator defines the service such that its selector will match all WebLogic server pods within the WebLogic cluster which are in the \u0026ldquo;ready\u0026rdquo; state.\nThe name of the service created for a WebLogic cluster follows the pattern \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-cluster-\u0026lt;clusterName\u0026gt;. For example, if the domainUID is domain1 and the cluster name is cluster-1, the corresponding service will be named domain1-cluster-cluster-1.\nThe service name must comply with standard Kubernetes rules for naming of objects and in particular with DNS-1035: \u0026gt; A DNS-1035 label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo;, start with an alphabetic character, and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. my-name, or abc-123, regex used for validation is [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?).\nTo comply with these requirements, if the domainUID or the cluster name contains some upper-case characters or underscores, then in the service name the upper-case characters will be converted to lower-case and underscores will be converted to hyphens. For example, if the domainUID is myDomain_1 and the cluster name is myCluster_1, the corresponding service will be named mydomain-1-cluster-mycluster-1.\nThe service, serviceName and servicePort, of a WebLogic cluster will be used in the routing rules defined in the Ingress object and the load balancer will route traffic to the WebLogic servers within the cluster based on the rules.\nMost common Ingress controllers, for example Traefik, Voyager, and nginx, understand that there are zero or more actual pods behind the service, and they actually build their backend list and route requests to those backends directly, not through the service. This means that requests are properly balanced across the pods, according to the load balancing algorithm in use. Most Ingress controllers also subscribe to updates on the service and adjust their internal backend sets when additional pods become ready, or pods enter a non-ready state.\n Steps to set up an Ingress load balancer  Install the Ingress controller.\nAfter the Ingress controller is running, it monitors Ingress resources in a given namespace(s) and acts accordingly.\n Create Ingress resource(s).\nIngress resources contain routing rules to one or more backends. An Ingress controller is responsible to apply the rules to the underlying load balancer. There are two approaches to create the Ingress resource:\n Use the Helm chart ingress-per-domain.\nEach Ingress provider supports a number of annotations in Ingress resources. This Helm chart allows you to define the routing rules without dealing with the detailed provider-specific annotations. Currently we support two Ingress providers: Traefik and Voyager.\n Create the Ingress resource manually from a YAML file.\nManually create an Ingress YAML file and then apply it to the Kubernetes cluster.\n   Guide and samples for Traefik and Voyager/HAProxy Traefik and Voyager/HAProxy are both popular Ingress controllers. Information about how to install and configure these to load balance WebLogic clusters is provided here:\n Traefik guide Voyager guide  Samples are also provided for these two Ingress controllers, showing how to manage multiple WebLogic clusters as the backends, using different routing rules, host-routing and path-routing; and TLS termination:\n Traefik samples Voyager samples  "

Also, the domain credentials secret must be created in the namespace where the Domain will be running.\nFor an example of a WebLogic domain resource using webLogicCredentialsSecret, see Docker Image Protection.\n The samples supplied with the WebLogic operator use a naming convention that follows the pattern \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt;-weblogic-credentials, where \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt; is the unique identifier of the domain, for example, domain1-weblogic-credentials.\nIf the WebLogic domain will be started in domain1-ns and the \u0026lt;domainUID\u0026gt; is domain1, an example of creating a Kubernetes generic secret is as follows:\n$ kubectl -n domain1-ns create secret generic domain1-weblogic-credentials \\ --from-file=username --from-file=password $ kubectl -n domain1-ns label secret domain1-weblogic-credentials \\ weblogic.domainUID=domain1 weblogic.domainName=domain1  Oracle recommends that you not include unencrypted passwords on command lines. Passwords and other sensitive data can be prompted for or looked up by shell scripts and/or tooling. For more information about creating Kubernetes secrets, see the Kubernetes Secrets documentation.\n The WebLogic operator\u0026rsquo;s introspector job will expect the secret key names to be:\n username password  For example, here is what results when describing the Kubernetes Secret:\n$ kubectl -n domain1-ns describe secret domain1-weblogic-credentials Name: domain1-weblogic-credentials Namespace: domain1-ns Labels: weblogic.domainName=domain1 weblogic.domainUID=domain1 Annotations: \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; Type: Opaque Data ==== password: 8 bytes username: 8 bytes  WebLogic domain image pull secret The WebLogic domain that the operator manages can have images that are protected in the registry. The imagePullSecrets setting on the Domain can be used to specify the Kubernetes Secret that holds the registry credentials.\nFor more information, see Docker Image Protection under Domain security.\n WebLogic operator image pull secret The Helm chart for installing the operator has an option to specify the image pull secret used for the operator\u0026rsquo;s image when using a private registry. The Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry should be created in the namespace where the operator is deployed.\nHere is an example of using the helm install command to set the image name and image pull secret:\n$ helm install kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \\ --set \u0026quot;image=my.io/my-operator-image:1.0\u0026quot; \\ --set \u0026quot;imagePullSecrets[0].name=my-operator-image-pull-secret\u0026quot; \\ --name my-weblogic-operator --namespace weblogic-operator-ns \\ --wait  For more information, see Install the operator Helm chart under User Guide.\n WebLogic operator configuration override secrets The WebLogic operator supports embedding macros within configuration override templates that reference Kubernetes secrets. These Kubernetes secrets can be created with any name in the namespace where the Domain will be running. The Kubernetes secret names are specified using configOverrideSecrets in the WebLogic Domain resource.\nFor more information, see Configuration overrides under User Guide.\n WebLogic operator external REST interface secret The operator can expose an external REST HTTPS interface which can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes tls secret is used to hold the certificate(s) and private key.\nFor more information, see Certificates under Securty.\n WebLogic operator internal REST interface secret The operator exposes an internal REST HTTPS interface with a self-signed certificate. The certificate is kept in a Kubernetes ConfigMap with the name weblogic-operator-cm using the key internalOperatorCert. The private key is kept in a Kubernetes Secret with the name weblogic-operator-secrets using the key internalOperatorKey. These Kubernetes objects are managed by the operator\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart and are part of the namespace where the WebLogic operator is installed.\nFor example, to see all the operator\u0026rsquo;s config maps and secrets when installed into the Kubernetes namespace weblogic-operator-ns, use:\n$ kubectl -n weblogic-operator-ns get cm,secret  "

For example, the command above would create a secret named sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials.\n Create a new image with a domain home by running the create-domain script. Follow the directions in the sample, including:\n Copying the sample kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image/create-domain-inputs.yaml file and updating your copy with the domainUID (sample-domain1), domain namespace (sample-domain1-ns), and the domainHomeImageBase (store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3).\n Setting weblogicCredentialsSecretName to the name of the secret containing the WebLogic credentials, in this case, sample-domain1-weblogic-credentials.\n Leaving the image empty unless you need to tag the new image that the script builds to a different name. If you set the domainHomeImageBuildPath property to ./docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt, make sure that your JAVA_HOME is set to a Java JDK version 1.8 or later.\n   For example, assuming you named your copy my-inputs.yaml:\n$ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/domain-home-in-image $ ./create-domain.sh -i my-inputs.yaml -o /some/output/directory -u weblogic -p welcome1 -e  You need to provide the WebLogic administration user name and password in the -u and -p options respectively, as shown in the example. When using this sample, the WebLogic Server credentials that you specify, in three separate places, must be consistent:\n The secret that you create for the credentials. The properties files in the sample project you choose to create the Docker image from. The parameters you supply to the create-domain.sh script.   If you specify the -e option, the script will generate the Kubernetes YAML files and apply them to your cluster. If you omit the -e option, the script will just generate the YAML files, but will not take any action on your cluster.\nIf you run the sample from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster, and you need to push the new image to a registry that is local to the cluster, you need to do the following:\n Set the image property in the inputs file to the target image name (including the registry hostname/port, and the tag if needed). If you want Kubernetes to pull the image from a private registry, create a Kubernetes secret to hold your credentials and set the imagePullSecretName property in the inputs file to the name of the secret. The Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace where the domain will be running. For more information, see domain home in image protection in the Security section.\n  Run the create-domain.sh script without the -e option. Push the image to the registry. Run the following command to create the domain.  $ kubectl apply -f /some/output/directory/weblogic-domains/sample-domain1/domain.yaml  Confirm that the operator started the servers for the domain:\na. Use kubectl to show that the domain resource was created:\n$ kubectl describe domain sample-domain1 -n sample-domain1-ns  b.

	"description": "",
	"content": " Our expectation is that customers will task the operator with managing hundreds of WebLogic domains across dozens of Kubernetes namespaces. Therefore, we have designed the operator with an efficient user-level threads pattern. We\u0026rsquo;ve used that pattern to implement an asynchronous call model for Kubernetes API requests. This call model has built-in support for timeouts, retries with exponential back-off, and lists that exceed the requested maximum size using the continuance functionality.\nUser-level thread pattern The user-level thread pattern is implemented by the classes in the oracle.kubernetes.operator.work package.\n Engine: The executor service and factory for Fibers. Fiber: The user-level thread. Fibers represent the execution of a single processing flow through a series of Steps. Fibers may be suspended and later resumed, and do not consume a Thread while suspended. Step: Individual CPU-bound activity in a processing flow. Packet: Context of the processing flow. NextAction: Used by a Step when it returns control to the Fiber to indicate what should happen next. Common \u0026lsquo;next actions\u0026rsquo; are to execute another Step or to suspend the Fiber. Component: Provider of SPI\u0026rsquo;s that may be useful to the processing flow. Container: Represents the containing environment and is a Component.  Each Step has a reference to the next Step in the processing flow; however, Steps are not required to indicate that the next Step be invoked by the Fiber when the Step returns a NextAction to the Fiber. This leads to common use cases where Fibers invoke a series of Steps that are linked by the \u0026lsquo;is-next\u0026rsquo; relationship, but just as commonly, use cases where the Fiber will invoke sets of Steps along a detour before returning to the normal flow.\nIn this sample, the caller creates an Engine, Fiber, linked set of Step instances, and Packet. The Fiber is then started. The Engine would typically be a singleton, since it\u0026rsquo;s backed by a ScheduledExecutorService. The Packet would also typically be pre-loaded with values that the Steps would use in their apply() methods.\nstatic class SomeClass { public static void main(String[] args) { Engine engine = new Engine(\u0026quot;worker-pool\u0026quot;); Fiber fiber = engine.createFiber(); Step step = new StepOne(new StepTwo(new StepThree(null))); Packet packet = new Packet(); fiber.start( step, packet, new CompletionCallback() { @Override public void onCompletion(Packet packet) { // Fiber has completed successfully } @Override public void onThrowable(Packet packet, Throwable throwable) { // Fiber processing was terminated with an exception } }); } }  Steps must not invoke sleep or blocking calls from within apply(). This prevents the worker threads from serving other Fibers. Instead, use asynchronous calls and the Fiber suspend/resume pattern. Step provides a method, doDelay(), which creates a NextAction to drive Fiber suspend/resume that is a better option than sleep precisely because the worker thread can serve other Fibers during the delay. For asynchronous IO or similar patterns, suspend the Fiber. In the callback as the Fiber suspends, initiate the asynchronous call. Finally, when the call completes, resume the Fiber. The suspend/resume functionality handles the case where resumed before the suspending callback completes.\nIn this sample, the step uses asynchronous file IO and the suspend/resume Fiber pattern.\nstatic class StepTwo extends Step { public StepTwo(Step next) { super(next); } @Override public NextAction apply(Packet packet) { return doSuspend((fiber) -\u0026gt; { // The Fiber is now suspended // Start the asynchronous call try { Path path = Paths.get(URI.create(this.getClass().getResource(\u0026quot;/somefile.dat\u0026quot;).toString())); AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel = AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.READ); ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024); fileChannel.read(buffer, 0, buffer, new CompletionHandler\u0026lt;Integer, ByteBuffer\u0026gt;() { @Override void completed(Integer result, ByteBuffer attachment) { // Store data in Packet and resume Fiber packet.put(\u0026quot;DATA_SIZE_READ\u0026quot;, result); packet.put(\u0026quot;DATA_FROM_SOMEFILE\u0026quot;, attachment); fiber.resume(packet); } @Override public void failed(Throwable exc, ByteBuffer attachment) { // log exc completed(0, null); } }); } catch (IOException e) { // log exception // If not resumed here, Fiber will never be resumed } }); } }  Call builder pattern The asynchronous call model is implemented by classes in the oracle.kubernetes.operator.helpers package, including CallBuilder and ResponseStep. The model is based on the Fiber suspend/resume pattern described above. CallBuilder provides many methods having names ending with \u0026ldquo;Async\u0026rdquo;, such as listPodAsync() or deleteServiceAsync(). These methods return a Step that can be returned as part of a NextAction. When creating these Steps, the developer must provide a ResponseStep. Only ResponseStep.onSuccess() must be implemented; however, it is often useful to override onFailure() as Kubernetes treats 404 (Not Found) as a failure.\nIn this sample, the developer is using the pattern to list pods from the default namespace that are labeled as part of cluster-1.\nstatic class StepOne extends Step { public StepOne(Step next) { super(next); } @Override public NextAction apply(Packet packet) { String namespace = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;; Step step = CallBuilder.create().with($ -\u0026gt; { $.labelSelector = \u0026quot;weblogic.clusterName=cluster-1\u0026quot;; $.limit = 50; $.timeoutSeconds = 30; }).listPodAsync(namespace, new ResponseStep\u0026lt;V1PodList\u0026gt;(next) { @Override public NextAction onFailure(Packet packet, ApiException e, int statusCode, Map\u0026lt;String, List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; responseHeaders) { if (statusCode == CallBuilder.NOT_FOUND) { return onSuccess(packet, null, statusCode, responseHeaders); } return super.onFailure(packet, e, statusCode, responseHeaders); } @Override NextAction onSuccess(Packet packet, V1PodList result, int statusCode, Map\u0026lt;String, List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; responseHeaders) { // do something with the result Pod, if not null return doNext(packet); } }); return doNext(step, packet); } }  Notice that the required parameters, such as namespace, are method arguments, but optional parameters are designated using a simplified builder pattern using with() and a lambda.\nThe default behavior of onFailure() will retry with an exponential backoff the request on status codes 429 (TooManyRequests), 500 (InternalServerError), 503 (ServiceUnavailable), 504 (ServerTimeout) or a simple timeout with no response from the server.\nIf the server responds with status code 409 (Conflict), then this indicates an optimistic locking failure. Common use cases are that the code read a Kubernetes object in one asynchronous step, modified the object, and attempted to replace the object in another asynchronous step; however, another activity replaced that same object in the interim. In this case, retrying the request would give the same result. Therefore, developers may provide an \u0026ldquo;on conflict\u0026rdquo; step when calling super.onFailure(). The conflict step will be invoked after an exponential backoff delay. In this example, that conflict step should be the step that reads the existing Kubernetes object.\n"

This initialization also includes looking for any stranded resources that, while created by the operator, no longer correlate with a Domain resource.\nAfter this, the operator starts watches for changes to Domain resources and any changes to other resources created by the operator. When a watch event is received, the operator processes the modified Domain resource to again bring the runtime presence in to alignment with the desired state.\nThe operator ensures that at most one Fiber is running for any given Domain. For instance, if the customer modifies a Domain resource to trigger a rolling restart, then the operator will create a Fiber to process this activity. However, if while the rolling restart is in process, the customer makes another change to the Domain resource, such as to increase the replicas field for a cluster, then the operator will cancel the in-flight Fiber and replace it with a new Fiber. This replacement processing must be able to handle taking over for the cancelled work regardless of where the earlier processing may have been in its flow. Therefore, domain processing always starts at the beginning of the \u0026ldquo;make right\u0026rdquo; flow without any state other than the current Domain resource.\nFinally, the operator periodically lists all Domains and rechecks them. This is a backstop against the possibility that a watch event is missed, such as because of a temporary network outage.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "  My domain will not start and I see errors like ImagePullBackoff or Cannot pull image\n When you see these kinds of errors it means that Kubernetes cannot find your Docker image. The most common causes are:\n The image value in your domain resource is set incorrectly, meaning Kubernetes will be trying to pull the wrong image The image requires authentication or permission in order to pull it and you have not configured Kubernetes with the necessary credentials, for example in an imagePullSecret You built the image on a machine that is not where your kubelet is running and Kubernetes cannot see the image, meaning you need to copy the image to the worker nodes or put it in a Docker registry that is accessible the to all of the worker nodes  Let\u0026rsquo;s review what happens when Kubernetes starts a pod.\nThe definition of the pod contains a list of container specifications. Each container specificiation contains the name (and optionally tag) of the image that should be used to run that container. In the example above, there is a container called c1 which is configured to use the Docker image some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0. This image name is in the format registry address / owner / name : tag, so in this case the registry is some.registry.com, then owner is owner, the image name is domain and the tag is 1.0. Tags are a lot like version numbers, but they are not required to be numbers or to be in any particular sequence or format. If you omit the tag, it is assumed to be latest.\nThe Docker tag latest is confusing - it does not actually mean the latest version of the image that was created or published in the registry, it just literally means whichever version the owner decided to call \u0026ldquo;latest\u0026rdquo;. Docker and Kubernetes make some assumptions about latest, and it is generally recommended to avoid using it and instead specify the actual version/tag that you really want.\n First, Kubernetes will check to see if the requested image is available in the local Docker image store on whichever worker node the pod was scheduled on. If it is there, then it will use that image to start the container. If it is not there, then Kubernetes will attempt to pull the image from a remote Docker registry.\nThere is another setting called imagePullPolicy that can be used to force Kubernetes to always pull the image, even if it is already present in the local Docker image store.\n If the image is available in the remote registry and it is public, that is it does not require authentication, then Kubernetes will pull the image to the local Docker image store and start the container.\nImages that require authentication If the remote Docker registry requires authentication, then you will need to provide the authentication details in a Kubernetes docker-registry secret and tell Kubernetes to use that secret when pulling the image.\nTo create a secret, you can use the following command:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry secret1 \\ --docker-server=some.registry.com \\ --docker-username=bob \\ --docker-password=bigSecret \\ --docker-email=bob@some.com \\ --namespace=default  In this command, you would replace secret1 with the name of the secret; the docker-server is set to the registry name, without the https:// prefix; the docker-username, docker-password and docker-email are set to match the credentials you use to authenticate to the remote Docker registry; and the namespace must be set to the same namespace where you intend to use the image.\nSome registries may need a suffix making the docker-server something like some.registry.com/v2 for example. You will need to check with your registry provider\u0026rsquo;s documentation to see if this is needed.\n After the secret is created, you need to tell Kubernetes to use it. This is done by adding an imagePullSecret to your Kubernetes YAML file. In the case of a WebLogic domain, you add the secret name to the imagePullSecret in the domain custom resource YAML file.\nHere is an example of part of a domain custom resource file with the imagePullSecret above specified:\napiVersion: \u0026quot;weblogic.oracle/v2\u0026quot; kind: Domain metadata: name: domain1 namespace: default labels: weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2 weblogic.domainUID: domain1 spec: domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/domain1 domainHomeInImage: true image: \u0026quot;some.registry.com/owner/domain1:1.0\u0026quot; imagePullPolicy: \u0026quot;IfNotPresent\u0026quot; imagePullSecrets: - name: secret1  Alternatively, you can associate the secret with the service account that will be used to run the pod. If you do this, then you will not need to add the imagePullSecret to the domain resource. This is useful if you are running multiple domains in the same namespace.\nTo add the secret shown above to the default service account in the weblogic namespace, you would use a command like this:\nkubectl patch serviceaccount default \\ -n weblogic \\ -p '{\u0026quot;imagePullSecrets\u0026quot;: [{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;secret1\u0026quot;}]}'  You can provide mutliple imagePullSecrets if you need to pull Docker images from multiple remote Docker registries or if your images require different authentication credentials. For more information, see Docker Image Protection under Security.\n Manually copying the image to your worker nodes If you are not able to use a remote Docker registry, for example if your Kubernetes cluster is in a secure network with no external access, you can manually copy the Docker images to the cluster instead.\nOn the machine where you created the image, export it into a tar file using this command:\ndocker save domain1:1.0 \u0026gt; domain1.tar  Then copy that tar file to each worker node in your Kubernetes cluster and run this command on each node:\ndocker load \u0026lt; domain1.tar  Restart pods to clear the error After you have ensured that the images are accessible on all worker nodes, you may need to restart the pods so that Kubernetes will attempt to pull the images again. You can do this by deleting the pods themselves, or deleting the domain resource and then recreating it.\n"

	"content": " Recent changes    Date Version Introduces backward incompatibilities Change     March 4, 2019 v2.0.1 no OpenShift support is now certified. Many bug fixes, including fixes for configuration overrides, cluster services, and domain status processing.   January 24, 2019 v2.0 yes; not compatible with 1.x releases, but is compatible with 2.0-rc2. Final version numbers and documentation updates.   January 16, 2019 v2.0-rc2 yes Schema updates are completed, and various bugs fixed.   December 20, 2018 v2.0-rc1 yes Operator is now installed via Helm charts, replacing the earlier scripts. The operator now supports the domain home on persistent volume or in Docker image use cases, which required a redesign of the domain schema. You can override the domain configuration using configuration override templates. Now load balancers and Ingresses can be independently configured. You can direct WebLogic logs to a persistent volume or to the pod\u0026rsquo;s log. Added life cycle support for servers and significantly enhanced configurability for generated pods. The final v2.0 release will be the initial release where the operator team intends to provide backward compatibility as part of future releases.   September 11, 2018 v1.1 no Enhanced the documentation and fixed various bugs.   May 7, 2018 v1.0 no Added support for dynamic clusters, the Apache HTTP Server, the Voyager Ingress Controller, and for PV in NFS storage for multi-node environments.   April 4, 2018 0.2 yes Many Kubernetes artifact names and labels have changed. Also, the names of generated YAML files for creating a domain\u0026rsquo;s PV and PVC have changed. Because of these changes, customers must recreate their operators and domains.   March 20, 2018  yes Several files and input parameters have been renamed. This affects how operators and domains are created. It also changes generated Kubernetes artifacts, therefore customers must recreate their operators and domains.    Known issues    Issue Description     None currently     "

	"content": " Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator Oracle is finding ways for organizations using WebLogic Server to run important workloads, to move those workloads into the cloud. By certifying on industry standards, such as Docker and Kubernetes, WebLogic now runs in a cloud neutral infrastructure. In addition, we\u0026rsquo;ve provided an open-source Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator (the “operator”) which has several key features to assist you with deploying and managing WebLogic domains in a Kubernetes environment. You can:\n Create WebLogic domains in a Kubernetes persistent volume. This persistent volume can reside in an NFS file system or other Kubernetes volume types. Create a WebLogic domain in a Docker image. Override certain aspects of the WebLogic domain configuration. Define WebLogic domains as a Kubernetes resource (using a Kubernetes custom resource definition). Start servers based on declarative startup parameters and desired states. Manage WebLogic configured or dynamic clusters. Expose the WebLogic Server Administration Console outside the Kubernetes cluster, if desired. Expose T3 channels outside the Kubernetes domain, if desired. Expose HTTP paths on a WebLogic domain outside the Kubernetes domain with load balancing and update the load balancer when Managed Servers in the WebLogic domain are started or stopped. Scale WebLogic domains by starting and stopping Managed Servers on demand, or by integrating with a REST API to initiate scaling based on WLDF, Prometheus, Grafana, or other rules. Publish operator and WebLogic Server logs into Elasticsearch and interact with them in Kibana.  The fastest way to experience the operator is to follow the Quick Start guide, or you can peruse our documentation, read our blogs, or try out the samples.\nThe current release of the operator is 2.0.1. This release was published on March 4, 2019.\nOperator earlier versions Documentation for prior releases of the operator is available here.\nBackward compatibility guidelines Starting from the 2.0.1 release, operator releases are backward compatible with respect to the domain resource schema, operator Helm chart input values, configuration overrides template, Kubernetes resources created by the operator Helm chart, Kubernetes resources created by the operator, and the operator REST interface. We intend to maintain compatibility for three releases, except in the case of a clearly communicated deprecated feature, which will be maintained for one release after a replacement is available.\nAbout this documentation This documentation includes sections targeted to different audiences. To help you find what you are looking for more easily, please consult this table of contents:\n The Quick Start guide explains how to quickly get the operator running, using the defaults, nothing special. The User guide contains detailed usage information, including how to install and configure the operator, and how to use it to create and manage WebLogic domains.\n The Samples provide detailed example code and instructions that show you how to perform various tasks related to the operator. The Developer guide provides details for people who want to understand how the operator is built, tested, and so on. Those who wish to contribute to the operator code will find useful information here. This section also includes API documentation (Javadoc) and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the REST APIs. The Contributing section provides information about contribution requirements.  User guide The User guide provides detailed information about all aspects of using the operator including:\n Installing and configuring the operator. Using the operator to create and manage WebLogic domains. Manually creating WebLogic domains to be managed by the operator. Scaling WebLogic clusters. Configuring Kubernetes load balancers. Configuring Elasticsearch and Kibana to access the operator\u0026rsquo;s log files. Shutting down domains. Removing/deleting domains. And much more!
