      <description>Each operator deployment manages a number of Kubernetes Namespaces. For more information, see Operator Helm configuration values. A number of Kubernetes resources must be present in a namespace before any WebLogic domain custom resources can be successfully deployed into it. Those Kubernetes resources are created either as part of the installation of the operator&amp;rsquo;s Helm chart, or created by the operator at runtime.
This FAQ describes some considerations to be aware of when you manage the namespaces while the operator is running.</description>

      <description>Overview WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator version 2.3 and later includes experimental support for Istio 1.2.2 and later. This support allows you to run the operator itself, and WebLogic domains managed by the operator, with Istio sidecar injection enabled. It will allow you to use Istio gateways and virtual services to access applications deployed in these domains. If your applications have suitable tracing code in them, then you will also be able to use distributed tracing, such as Jaeger, to trace requests across domains and to other components and services that have tracing enabled.</description>

      <description>Docker images are composed of layers, as shown in the diagram below. If you download the standard weblogic:12.2.1.4 image from the Oracle Container Registry, then you can see these layers using the command docker inspect container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 (the domain layer will not be there). You are not required to use layers, but efficient use of layers is considered a best practice.
Why is it important to maintain the layering of images? Layering is an important technique in Docker images.</description>

      <description>WebLogic domain in Docker image protection Oracle strongly recommends storing the Docker images that contain a WebLogic domain home as private in the Docker registry. In addition to any local registry, public Docker registries include Docker Hub and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR).
 The WebLogic domain home that is part of a Docker image contains sensitive information about the domain including keys and credentials that are used to access external resources (for example, the data source password).</description>

      <description>Updating operator external certificates If the operator needs to update the external certificate and key currently being used or was installed without an external REST API SSL/TLS identity, the helm upgrade command is used to restart the operator with the new or updated Kubernetes tls secret that contains the desired certificates.
The operator requires a restart in order to begin using the new or updated external certificate. The Helm --recreate-pods flag is used to cause the existing Kubernetes Pod to be terminated and a new pod to be started with the updated configuration.</description>

  Create the domain namespace or namespaces. One or more domains can share a namespace. A single instance of the operator can manage multiple namespaces.
$ kubectl create namespace domain-namespace-1 Replace domain-namespace-1 with name you want to use. The name must follow standard Kubernetes naming conventions, that is, lower case, numbers, and hyphens.
  Create a Kubernetes Secret containing the Administration Server boot credentials.</description>

After creating Kubernetes clusters, you can optionally:
 Create load balancers to direct traffic to backend domains. Configure Kibana and Elasticsearch for your operator logs.  Load balance with an ingress controller or a web server You can choose a load balancer provider for your WebLogic domains running in a Kubernetes cluster. For information about the current capabilities and setup instructions for each of the supported load balancers, see the WebLogic Operator Load Balancer Samples.</description>

      <description>An operator is an application-specific controller that extends Kubernetes to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications. The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator follows the standard Kubernetes operator pattern, and simplifies the management and operation of WebLogic domains and deployments.
You can have one or more operators in your Kubernetes cluster that manage one or more WebLogic domains each. We provide a Helm chart to manage the installation and configuration of the operator.</description>

      <description>Use this Quick Start guide to create a WebLogic deployment in a Kubernetes cluster with the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator. Please note that this walk-through is for demonstration purposes only, not for use in production. These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes. If you need more detailed instructions, please refer to the User guide.
All Kubernetes distributions and managed services have small differences. In particular, the way that persistent storage and load balancers are managed varies significantly.</description>

      <description>How does layering affect our CI/CD process? Now that we know more about layering, let’s talk about why it is important to our CI/CD process. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the kinds of updates we might want to make to our domain:
You might want to update the domain by:
 Installing a patch on the operating system or a library. Updating the version of the JDK you are using. Picking up a new version of WebLogic Server.</description>

      <description>WebLogic T3 channels Oracle recommends not exposing any administrative, RMI, or T3 channels outside the Kubernetes cluster unless absolutely necessary. If exposing any of these channels, limit access using controls like security lists or set up a Bastion to provide access.
 When accessing T3 or RMI based channels, the preferred approach is to kubectl exec into the Kubernetes Pod and then run wlst, or set up Bastion access and then run wlst from the Bastion host to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>This document describes when to restart servers in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.
Overview There are many situations where changes to the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment require that all the servers in a domain or cluster be restarted, for example, when applying a WebLogic Server patch or when upgrading an application.
One of the operator&amp;rsquo;s most important jobs is to start and stop WebLogic Servers by creating and deleting their corresponding Kubernetes Pods.</description>

      <description>For this exercise, you’ll need a Kubernetes cluster. If you need help setting one up, check out our cheat sheet. This guide assumes a single node cluster.
The operator uses Helm to create and deploy the necessary resources and then run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. For Helm installation and usage information, see Install Helm and Tiller.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review what we have discussed and talk about when we might want to use various approaches. We can start by asking ourselves questions like these:
  Can you make the desired change with a configuration override or Model in Image ConfigMap?
When your domain home source type is Domain in PV or Domain in Image, the operator allows you to inject a number of configuration overrides into your pods before starting any servers in the domain.</description>

      <description>The operator consists of the following parts:
 The operator runtime, a process that runs in a Docker container deployed into a Kubernetes Pod and which performs the actual management tasks. The model for a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) that when installed in a Kubernetes cluster allows the Kubernetes API server to manage instances of this new type representing the operational details and status of WebLogic domains.

      <description>You can use the WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) to manage a domain running in Kubernetes. If the Administration Server was configured to expose a T3 channel using the exposeAdminT3Channel setting when creating the domain, then the matching T3 service can be used to connect. For example, if the domainUID is domain1, and the Administration Server name is admin-server, then the service would be called:
domain1-admin-server-external This service will be in the same namespace as the domain.</description>

The introspection job also addresses the use of Kubernetes Secrets with configuration overrides. For additional information on the configuration handling, see Configuration overrides.
The introspection job also creates a boot.properties file that is made available to the pods in the WebLogic domain. The credential used for the WebLogic domain is kept in a Kubernetes Secret which follows the naming pattern &amp;lt;domainUID&amp;gt;-weblogic-credentials, where &amp;lt;domainUID&amp;gt; is the unique identifier of the domain, for example, mydomain-weblogic-credentials.</description>

      <description>WebLogic Server supports two types of clustering configurations, configured and dynamic. Configured clusters are created by manually configuring each individual Managed Server instance. In dynamic clusters, the Managed Server configurations are generated from a single, shared template. With dynamic clusters, when additional server capacity is needed, new server instances can be added to the cluster without having to manually configure them individually. Also, unlike configured clusters, scaling up of dynamic clusters is not restricted to the set of servers defined in the cluster but can be increased based on runtime demands.</description>

      <description>If you need to mutate the domain layer, and keep the same domain encryption keys, then there are some choices about how to implement that, as alluded to previously. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore those in some more detail now.
The first option is to implement each mutation as a delta to the previous state. This is conceptually similar to how immutable objects (like Java Strings) are implemented, a &amp;ldquo;copy on write&amp;rdquo; approach applied to the domain configuration as a unit.</description>

      <description>The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator (the “operator”) is designed to fulfill a similar role to that which a human operator would fill in a traditional data center deployment. It contains a set of useful built-in knowledge about how to perform various life cycle operations on a domain correctly.
Human operators are typically responsible for starting and stopping environments, initiating backups, performing scaling operations, performing manual tasks associated with disaster recovery and high availability needs and coordinating actions with other operators in other data centers.</description>

      <description>WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator ServiceAccounts When the operator is installed, the Helm chart property, serviceAccount, can be specified where the value contains the name of the Kubernetes ServiceAccount in the namespace in which the operator will be installed. For more information about the Helm chart, see the Operator Helm configuration values.
The operator will use this ServiceAccount when calling the Kubernetes API server and the appropriate access controls will be created for this ServiceAccount by the operator&amp;rsquo;s Helm chart.</description>

      <description>The project includes integration tests that can be run against a Kubernetes cluster. If you want to use these tests, you will need to provide your own Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster must meet the version number requirements and have Helm installed. Ensure that the operator Docker image is in a Docker registry visible to the Kubernetes cluster.
You will need to obtain the kube.config file for an administrative user and make it available on the machine running the build.</description>

      <description>The master branch is protected and contains source for the most recently published release, including release candidates.
The develop branch is protected and contains source for the latest completed features and bug fixes. While this branch contains active work, we expect to keep it always &amp;ldquo;ready to release.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, longer running feature work will be performed on specific branches, such as feature/dynamic-clusters.
Because we want to balance separating destabilizing work into feature branches against the possibility of later difficult merges, we encourage developers working on features to pull out any necessary refactoring or improvements that are general purpose into their own shorter-lived branches and create pull requests to develop when these smaller work items are completed.</description>

      <guid>/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/cicd/how-to-copy-domains/</guid>
      <description>The recommended approach to save a copy of a Domain in Image or Domain in PV domain is to simply ZIP (or tar) the domain directory. However, there is a very important caveat with this recommendation - when you unzip the domain, it must go back into exactly the same location (Domain Home) in the (new) file system. Using this approach will maintain the same domain encryption key.
The best practice/recommended approach is to create a &amp;ldquo;primordial domain&amp;rdquo; which does not contain any applications or resources, and to create a ZIP file of this domain before starting any servers.</description>

For example, the createDomain tool creates a new domain based on a simple model, and updateDomain (and deployApps) uses the same model concept to update an existing domain (preserving the same domain encryption key). The deployApps tool is very similar to the updateDomain tool, but limits what can be updated to application-related configuration attributes such as data sources and application archives.</description>

      <description>Our expectation is that customers will task the operator with managing hundreds of WebLogic domains across dozens of Kubernetes Namespaces. Therefore, we have designed the operator with an efficient user-level threads pattern. We&amp;rsquo;ve used that pattern to implement an asynchronous call model for Kubernetes API requests. This call model has built-in support for timeouts, retries with exponential back-off, and lists that exceed the requested maximum size using the continuance functionality.</description>

      <description>When the operator starts, it lists all existing Domain resources and processes these domains to create the necessary Kubernetes resources, such as Pods and Services, if they don&amp;rsquo;t already exist. This initialization also includes looking for any stranded resources that, while created by the operator, no longer correlate with a Domain resource.
After this, the operator starts watches for changes to Domain resources and any changes to other resources created by the operator.</description>

 When you see these kinds of errors, it means that Kubernetes cannot find your Docker image. The most common causes are:
 The image value in your domain resource is set incorrectly, meaning Kubernetes will be trying to pull the wrong image. The image requires authentication or permission in order to pull it and you have not configured Kubernetes with the necessary credentials, for example in an imagePullSecret.</description>

      <description>To support Fast Application Notifications (FAN), Oracle databases configure GRID (Oracle Grid Infrastructure). GRID is typically associated with (and required by) Oracle RAC databases but can also be used in other configurations. Oracle Autonomous Database-Serverless (ATP-S) does not provide GRID.
When connecting to a database that does not have GRID, the only type of WebLogic Server data source that is supported is the Generic Data Sources. Multi Data Sources and Active GridLink data sources cannot be used because they work with RAC.</description>

      <description>If you are running your Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (commonly known as OKE), and you use OCI File Storage (FSS) for persistent volumes to store the WebLogic domain home, then the file system handling demonstrated in the operator persistent volume sample will require an update to properly initialize the file ownership on the persistent volume when the domain is initially created.
File permission handling on persistent volumes can differ between cloud providers and even with the underlying storage handling on Linux based systems.</description>

      <description>If you are running your Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (commonly known as OKE), you can have OCI automatically provision load balancers for you by creating a Service of type LoadBalancer instead of (or in addition to) installing an ingress controller like Traefik or Voyager.
OKE Kubernetes worker nodes typically do not have public IP addresses. This means that the NodePort services created by the operator are not usable, because they would expose ports on the worker node&amp;rsquo;s private IP addresses only, which are not reachable from outside the cluster.</description>

Contents  Check the domain resource status Check the introspector job Check the WebLogic Server pods Check an operator log  Check the domain resource status To check the domain resource status: kubectl -n MY_NAMESPACE describe domain MY_DOMAINUID.
Check the introspector job If your introspector job failed, then examine the kubectl describe of the job and its pod, and also examine its log, if one exists.</description>

      <description>I need to provide an instance with access to a PersistentVolumeClaim.
 Some applications need access to a file, either to read data or to provide additional logging beyond what is built into the operator. One common way of doing that within Kubernetes is to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and map it to a file. The domain configuration can then be used to provide access to the claim across the domain, within a single cluster, or for a single server.</description>

      <description>I need to provide an instance with access to a ConfigMap.
 Configuration files can be supplied to Kubernetes Pods and Jobs by a ConfigMap, which consists of a set of key-value pairs. Each entry may be accessed by one or more operator-managed nodes as a read-only text file. Access can be provided across the domain, within a single cluster, or for a single server. In each case, the access is configured within the serverPod element of the desired scope.</description>

      <description>Approaches There are two supported approaches for giving external WebLogic EJB or JMS clients access to a Kubernetes hosted WebLogic cluster: Load balancer tunneling and Kubernetes NodePorts.
This FAQ is for remote EJB and JMS clients - not JTA clients. The operator does not currently support external WebLogic JTA access to a WebLogic cluster, because external JTA access requires each server in the cluster to be individually addressable by the client, but this conflicts with the current operator requirement that a network channel in a cluster have the same port across all servers in the cluster.</description>

      <description>If you are running Coherence on Kubernetes, either inside a WebLogic domain or standalone, then there are some additional requirements to make sure that Coherence can form clusters.
Note that some Fusion Middleware products, like SOA Suite, use Coherence and so these requirements apply to them.
Unicast and Well Known Address When the first Coherence process starts, it will form a cluster. The next Coherence process to start (for example, in a different pod), will use UDP to try to contact the senior member.</description>
