This release is primarily a bug fix release and resolves the following issues: Servers in domains, where the domain home is on a persistent volume, would sometimes fail to start. These failures would be during the introspection phase following a full domain shutdown.  Now, the introspection script better handles the relevant error conditions. Also, now the Domain provides an option to [pre-create Kubernetes Services](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/main/documentation/domains/Domain.md#server-service) for WebLogic Servers that are not yet running so that the DNS addresses of these services are resolvable.  These services are now created as non-headless so that they have an IP address. |

You can direct WebLogic logs to a persistent volume or to the pod's log.  Added life cycle support for servers and significantly enhanced configurability for generated pods.

* Resolved an issue where the operator would log a SEVERE message about failing to create the CRD even though the creation was successful ([#2772](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2772)).
* Domain resource status now correctly displays problems pulling auxiliary container images ([#2681](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2681)).
* Resolved an issue related to high CPU usage in the `startServer.sh` script ([#2684](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2684)).
* Resolved [issue #2685](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/issues/2685) related to an NPE while reading server health information ([#2692](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2692)).
* Resolved an issue related to the `create-domain.sh` sample script ([#2696](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2696)).
