Azure Kubernetes Service makes it simple to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for you. The Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure. You manage and maintain only the agent nodes. As a managed Kubernetes service, AKS is free - you pay for only the agent nodes within your clusters, not for the masters.
