description: "Sample for creating an FMW Infrastructure domain home inside an image, and the domain resource YAML file for deploying the generated WebLogic domain."
---


The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a FMW Infrastructure domain home in an image using
[WebLogic Image Tool](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-image-tool/) (WIT).
The sample scripts have the option of putting the WebLogic domain log, server logs, server output files,
and the Node Manager logs on an existing Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
The scripts also generate the domain resource YAML file, which can then be used by the scripts or used manually
to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain, including the WebLogic Server pods and services.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, read this document, [Domain resource]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource/_index.md" >}}).

The following prerequisites must be met prior to running the create domain script:

* Make sure the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is running.
* The operator requires an image with either FMW Infrastructure 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied or FMW Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0.
  For details on how to obtain or create the image, refer to
  [FMW Infrastructure domains]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/#obtaining-the-fmw-infrastructure-image" >}}).
* Create a Kubernetes Namespace for the domain unless you intend to use the default namespace.
* If `logHomeOnPV` is enabled, create the Kubernetes PersistentVolume where the log home will be hosted, and the Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim for the domain in the same Kubernetes Namespace. For samples to create a PV and PVC, see [Create sample PV and PVC]({{< relref "/samples/storage/_index.md" >}}).
* Create the Kubernetes Secrets `username` and `password` of the administrative account in the same Kubernetes
  namespace as the domain.
* Unless you are creating a Restricted-JRF domain, you also need to:
  * Configure access to your database. For details, see [here]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/_index.md#configuring-access-to-your-database" >}}).  
  * Create a Kubernetes Secret with the RCU credentials. For details, refer to this [document](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/main/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-credentials/README.md).

#### Use the script to create a domain

The sample for creating domains is in this directory:

```shell
$ cd kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-fmw-infrastructure-domain/domain-home-in-image
```
Make a copy of the `create-domain-inputs.yaml` file, update it with the correct values.
If `fwmDomainType` is `JRF`, also update the input files with configurations for accessing the RCU database schema,
including `rcuSchemaPrefix`, `rcuSchemaPassword`, `rcuDatabaseURL`, and `rcuCredentialSecrets`.
Run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory, along with user name and password for the WebLogic administrator,
and if creating a JFR FMW domain, also provide the password for the RCU schema:

```shell
$ ./create-domain.sh \
  -u <username> \
  -p <password> \
  -q <RCU schema password> \
  -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \
  -o /<path to output-directory>
```
{{% notice note %}} The `create-domain.sh` script and its inputs file are for demonstration purposes _only_; its contents and the domain resource file that it generates for you might change without notice. In production, we strongly recommend that you use the WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tooling (when applicable), and directly work with domain resource files instead.
{{% /notice%}}

The script will perform the following steps:

* Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not
  already exist.  The path name is `/<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>`.
  If the directory already exists, its contents must be removed before using this script.

* Create a properties file, `domain.properties`, in the directory that is created above.
  This properties file will be used to create a sample FMW Infrastructure domain.
  The `domain.properties` file will be removed upon successful completion of the script.

* Download the latest [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-deploy-tooling/) (WDT) and [WebLogic Image Tool](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-image-tool/) installer ZIP files to your `/tmp/dhii-sample/tools` directory.
  WIT is required to create your Domain in Image container images, and WDT is required if using `wdt` mode.
  Visit the GitHub [WebLogic Deploy Tooling Releases](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases) and [WebLogic Image Tool Releases](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases) web pages to determine the latest release version for each.

* Set up the WebLogic Image Tool in the `<toolsDir>/imagetool` directory, where `<toolsDir>` is the
  directory specified in the `toolsDir` parameter in the inputs YAML file. Set the
  WIT cache store location to the `<tools>/imagetool-cache` directory and
  put a `wdt_<WDT_VERSION>` entry in the tool's cache, which points to the path of the WDT ZIP file installer.
  For more information about the WIT cache, see the
  [WIT Cache documentation](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-image-tool/userguide/tools/cache/).

* If the optional `-n` option and an encryption key is provided, invoke the WDT
  [Encrypt Model Tool](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-deploy-tooling/userguide/tools/encrypt/)
  in a container running the image specified in `domainHomeImageBase` parameter in your inputs file
  to encrypt the password properties in `domain.properties` file. Note that this password encryption
  step is skipped if the value of the `mode` parameter in the inputs YAML file is `wlst` because
  the feature is provided by WDT.

* Invoke the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-image-tool/) to create a new
  FWM Infrastructure domain based on the FMW Infrastructure image specified in the `domainHomeImageBase`
  parameter from your inputs file. The new WebLogic Server domain is created using one of the
  following options based on the value of the `mode` parameter in the inputs YAML file:
  * If the value of the `mode` parameter is `wdt`, the WDT model specified in the `createDomainWdtModel`
    parameter and the WDT variables in `domain.properties` file are used by the WebLogic Image Tool to create
    the new WebLogic Server domain.
  * If the value of the `mode` parameter is `wlst`, the offline WLST
    script specified in the `createDomainWlstScript` parameter is run to create the new WebLogic Server domain.

* The generated image is tagged with the `image` parameter provided in your inputs file.

  {{% notice warning %}}
  Oracle strongly recommends storing the image containing the domain home as private
  in the registry (for example, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry, GitHub Container Registry, and such) because
  this image contains sensitive information about the domain, including keys and
  credentials that are used to access external resources (for example, the data source password).
  For more information, see
  [WebLogic domain in image protection]({{<relref "/security/domain-security/image-protection#weblogic-domain-in-container-image-protection">}}).
  {{% /notice %}}

* Create a Kubernetes domain resource YAML file, `domain.yaml`, in the directory that is created above.
  This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the `kubectl create -f`
  or `kubectl apply -f` command:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl apply -f /<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>/domain.yaml
    ```

As a convenience, using the `-e` option, the script can optionally create the domain object,
which in turn results in the creation of the corresponding WebLogic Server pods and services as well.

The usage of the create script is as follows:

```shell
$ sh create-domain.sh -h
```
```text
usage: create-domain.sh -o dir -i file -u username -p password [-q rcuSchemaPassword] [-b buildNetworkParam] [-n encryption-key] [-e] [-v] [-h]
  -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified.
  -o Output directory for the generated YAML files, must be specified.
  -u WebLogic administrator user name for the WebLogic domain.
  -p WebLogic administrator Password for the WebLogic domain.
  -q Password for the RCU schema. Required for JRF FMW domain type.
  -e Also create the resources in the generated YAML files, optional.
  -v Validate the existence of persistentVolumeClaim, optional.
  -n Encryption key for encrypting passwords in the WDT model and properties files, optional.
  -b Value to be used in the buildNetwork parameter when invoking WebLogic Image Tool, optional.
  -h Help
```

If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in
the `<weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project>/kubernetes/samples/scripts` directory together
into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.

The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:

* An Administration Server named `admin-server` listening on port `7001`.
* A configured cluster named `cluster-1` of size 3.
* Three Managed Servers, named `managed-server1`, `managed-server2`, and so on, listening on port `8001`.
* Log files that are located in `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`.
* No applications deployed.
* No data sources or JMS resources.
* A T3 channel.

The domain creation inputs can be customized by editing `create-domain-inputs.yaml`.

#### Configuration parameters
The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.

| Parameter | Definition | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adminPort` | Port number of the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. | `7001` |
| `adminNodePort` | Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `30701` |
| `adminServerName` | Name of the Administration Server. | `admin-server` |
| `clusterName` | Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. | `cluster-1` |
| `configuredManagedServerCount` | Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. This value is ignored when using WDT with a model that creates configured cluster where the number of Managed Server instances is determined by the WDT model specified by `createDomainWdtModel`.  | `5` |
| `createDomainWdtModel` | WDT model YAML file that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain when using wdt `mode`. This value is ignored when the `mode` is set to `wlst`. | `wdt/wdt_model_configured.yaml` or `wdt/wdt_model_restricted_jrf_configured.yaml` depending on the value of `fmwDomainType` |
| `createDomainWlstScript` | WLST script that the create domain script uses to create a WebLogic domain when using wlst `mode`. This value is ignored when the `mode` is set to `wdt` (which is the default `mode`). | `../../common/createFMWJRFDomain.py` or `../../common/createFMWRestrictedJRFDomain.py` depending on the value of `fmwDomainType` |
| `domainHome` | Domain home directory of the WebLogic domain to be created in the generated WebLogic Server image. | `/u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/<domainUID>` |
| `domainHomeImageBase` | Base OracleFMWInfrastructure binary image used to build the OracleFMWInfrastructure domain image. The operator requires FMW Infrastructure 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied or FMW Infrastructure 12.2.1.4.0. For details on how to obtain or create the image, see [FMW Infrastructure domains]({{< relref "/userguide/managing-fmw-domains/#obtaining-the-fmw-infrastructure-image" >}}). | `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` |
| `domainPVMountPath` | Mount path of the domain persistent volume. | `/shared` |
| `domainUID` | Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Domain. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes Service name. | `domain1` |
| `exposeAdminNodePort` | Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `exposeAdminT3Channel` | Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `fmwDomainType` | FMW Infrastructure Domain Type. Legal values are `JRF` or `RestrictedJRF`. | `JRF` |
| `httpAccessLogInLogHome` | Boolean indicating if server HTTP access log files should be written to the same directory as `logHome`. Otherwise, server HTTP access log files will be written to the directory specified in the WebLogic domain home configuration. | `true` |
| `image` | Oracle FMW Infrastructure Server image that the operator uses to start the domain. The create domain scripts generate a Oracle FMW Infrastructure Server image with a domain home in it. By default, the scripts tag the generated Oracle FMW Infrastructure Server image as  `domain-home-in-image`, and use it plus the tag that is obtained from the `domainHomeImageBase` to set the `image` element in the generated domain resource YAML file. If this property is set, the create domain scripts will use the value specified, instead of the default value, to tag the generated image and set the `image` in the domain resource YAML file. A unique value is required for each domain that is created using the scripts. If you are running the sample scripts from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster where the domain is going to be running, you need to set this property to the image name that is intended to be used in a registry local to that Kubernetes cluster. You also need to push the `image` to that registry before starting the domain using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command. | `domain-home-in-image:<tag from domainHomeImageBase>`|
| `imagePullPolicy` | Oracle FMW Infrastructure Server image pull policy. Legal values are `IfNotPresent`, `Always`, or `Never`. | `IfNotPresent` |
| `imagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes Secret to access the container registry to pull the WebLogic Server image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified. |  |
| `includeServerOutInPodLog` | Boolean indicating whether to include the server `.out` in the pod's `stdout`. | `true` |
| `initialManagedServerReplicas` | Number of Managed Servers to start initially for the domain. | `1` |
| `javaOptions` | Java options for starting the Administration Server and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: `$(DOMAIN_NAME)`, `$(DOMAIN_HOME)`, `$(ADMIN_NAME)`, `$(ADMIN_PORT)`, and `$(SERVER_NAME)`. | `-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false` |
| `logHome` | The in-pod location for the domain log, server logs, server out, Node Manager log, introspector out, and server HTTP access log files. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`. | `/shared/logs/domain1` |
| `managedServerNameBase` | Base string used to generate Managed Server names. | `managed-server` |
| `managedServerPort` | Port number for each Managed Server. | `8001` |
| `mode` | Whether to use the WDT model specified in `createDomainWdtModel` or the offline WLST script specified in `createDomainWlstScript` to create a WebLogic domain. Legal values are `wdt` or `wlst`. | `wdt` |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes Namespace in which to create the domain. | `default` |
| `persistentVolumeClaimName` | Name of the persistent volume claim. If not specified, the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `<domainUID>-weblogic-sample-pvc`. | `domain1-weblogic-sample-pvc` |
| `productionModeEnabled` | Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. | `true` |
| `serverStartPolicy` | Determines which WebLogic Server instances will be started. Legal values are `NEVER`, `IF_NEEDED`, `ADMIN_ONLY`. | `IF_NEEDED` |
| `t3ChannelPort` | Port for the T3 channel of the network access point. | `30012` |
| `t3PublicAddress` | Public address for the T3 channel.  This should be set to the public address of the Kubernetes cluster.  This would typically be a load balancer address. <p/>For development environments only, in a single server (all-in-one) Kubernetes Deployment, this may be set to the address of the master, or at the very least, it must be set to the address of one of the worker nodes. | If not provided, the script will attempt to set it to the IP address of the Kubernetes cluster. |
| `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes Secret for the Administration Server user name and password. If not specified, then the value is derived from the `domainUID` as `<domainUID>-weblogic-credentials`. | `domain1-weblogic-credentials` |
| `serverPodCpuRequest`, `serverPodMemoryRequest`, `serverPodCpuCLimit`, `serverPodMemoryLimit` |  The maximum amount of compute resources allowed, and minimum amount of compute resources required, for each server pod. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on `Managing Compute Resources for Containers` for details. | Resource requests and resource limits are not specified. |
| `rcuCredentialsSecret` | The Kubernetes Secret containing the database credentials. | `domain1-rcu-credentials` |
| `rcuDatabaseURL` | The database URL. | `database:1521/service` |
| `rcuSchemaPrefix` | The schema prefix to use in the database, for example `SOA1`.  You may wish to make this the same as the domainUID in order to simplify matching domains to their RCU schemas. | `domain1` |
| `toolsDir` | The directory where WebLogic Deploy Tool and WebLogic Image Tool are installed. The script will install these tools to this directory if they are not already installed. | `/tmp/dhii-sample/tools` |
| `wdtVersion` | Version of the WebLogic Deploy Tool to be installed by the script. This can be a specific version, such as 1.9.10, or `LATEST`.  | `LATEST` |
| `witVersion` | Version of the WebLogic Image Tool to be installed by the script. This can be a specific version, such as 1.9.10, or `LATEST`.  | `LATEST` |

Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the
value of some of the properties specified in the inputs YAML file. Those properties include
the `adminServerName`, `clusterName`, and `managedServerNameBase`. If those values contain any
characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes Service name, those characters are converted to
valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a
lowercase letter and an underscore `("_")` is converted to a hyphen `("-")`.

The sample demonstrates how to create a FMW Infrastructure domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain
that has one cluster only. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts
to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain resource YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.

#### Verify the results

The create script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error.
However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the
various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

Note that the example results below use the `default` Kubernetes Namespace. If you are using a different
namespace, you need to replace `NAMESPACE` in the example `kubectl` commands with the actual Kubernetes Namespace.

```

In the `Status` section of the output, the available servers and clusters are listed.
Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be
no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers.
The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready
before starting the Managed Servers.

#### Verify the pods

Use the following command to see the pods running the servers:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fmwdomain-admin-server                   1/1     Running   0          14m
fmwdomain-managed-server1                1/1     Running   0          12m
```

#### Verify the services

Use the following command to see the services for the domain:

```shell
$ kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:
```shell
$ kubectl get services
```
```
NAME                                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

fmwdomain-cluster-cluster-1         ClusterIP   10.107.55.188    <none>        8001/TCP          15h
fmwdomain-managed-server1           ClusterIP   None             <none>        8001/TCP          15h
```

#### Delete the domain

The generated YAML file in the `/<path to output-directory>/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>` directory can be used to delete the Kubernetes resource. Use the following command to delete the domain:

```shell
$ kubectl delete -f domain.yaml
```

#### Delete the generated image.

When no longer needed, delete the generated image.
If the image is in a local repository, use the following command to delete an image tagged with `domain-home-in-image:12.2.1.4`:

```shell
$ docker rmi domain-home-in-image:12.2.1.4
```

#### Delete the tools directory.

When no longer needed, delete the directory where WebLogic Deploy Tool and WebLogic Image Tool are installed.
By default, they are installed under `/tmp/dhii-sample/tools` directory.

```shell
$ rm -rf /tmp/dhii-sample/tools/
```
### Troubleshooting
***Message***: `Failed to build JDBC Connection object`

If the WebLogic Image Tool failed to create a domain and the following error is seen in the output:
```shell

```

First, verify that the JDBC connection URL shown in the output is correct. Update the `rcuDatabaseURL` parameter in the inputs YAML file to the correct value if necessary.

If the JDBC connection URL is correct, it is possible that the container in which the WebLogic Image Tool is running for creating a WebLogic domain, is not using the correct networking stack.
The optional `-b` option in the `create-domain.sh` script can be used to specify the networking mode for the RUN instruction during image build.
For example, to use the host's network stack, invoke `create-domain.sh` with `-b host`.
Please refer to Docker Network Settings references for supported networking options.
