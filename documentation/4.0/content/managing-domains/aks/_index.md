### Introduction

{{< readfile file="/samples/azure-kubernetes-service/includes/aks-value-prop.txt" >}}

This document describes the Azure Marketplace offer that makes it easy to get started with WebLogic Server on Azure. The offer handles all the initial setup, creating the AKS cluster, container registry, WebLogic Kubernetes Operator installation, and domain creation using the model-in-image domain home source type. For complete details on domain home source types, see [Choose a domain home source type]({{< relref "/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/_index.md" >}}).

It is also possible to run the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator manually, without the aid of the Azure Marketplace offer.  The steps for doing so are documented in the sample [Azure Kubernetes Service]({{< relref "/samples/azure-kubernetes-service/_index.md" >}}).

### Basics

Use the **Basics** blade to provide the basic configuration details for deploying an Oracle WebLogic Server configured cluster. To do this, enter the values for the fields listed in the following tables.

#### Project details


| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Subscription | Select a subscription to use for the charges accrued by this offer. You must have a valid active subscription associated with the Azure account that is currently logged in. If you donâ€™t have it already, follow the steps described in [Associate or add an Azure subscription to your Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).|
| Resource group | A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization. If you have an existing resource group into which you want to deploy this solution, you can enter its name here; however, the resource group must have no pre-existing resources in it. Alternatively, you can click the **Create new**, and enter the name so that Azure creates a new resource group before provisioning the resources.  For more information about resource groups, see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups). |

### Useful resources

Review the following useful resources.

#### Store the TLS/SSL certificate in the Key Vault

1. Base 64 encode the certificate file; omit the `-w0` for macOS:

    ```bash
    base64 myIdentity.jks -w0 >mycert.txt
    # base64 myIdentity.p12 -w0 >mycert.txt
    # base64 myTrust.jks -w0 >mycert.txt
    # base64 myTrust.p12 -w0 >mycert.txt
    # base64 root.cert -w0 >mycert.txt
    # base64 gatewayCert.pfx -w0 >mycert.txt
    ```

2. From the Azure portal, open your Key Vault.
3. In the Settings section, select Secrets.
4. Select Generate/Import.
5. Under Upload options, leave the default value.
6. Under Name, enter `myIdentityCertData`, or whatever name you like.
7. Under Value, enter the content of the mycert.txt file.
8. Leave the remaining values at their defaults and select Create.
