### Introduction

The operator provides an optional REST API for advanced users.
You can use the API as an alternative method for getting a list of WebLogic domains and clusters (for example, instead of calling `kubectl get domains`),
or for getting certain aspects of a domain's status (for example, instead of calling `kubectl get domain MYDOMAIN -o yaml`).
You also can use the REST API as an alternative approach for initiating scaling operations
(instead of using the Kubernetes API or command line to alter a domain resource's `replicas` values).

### Configure the operator's external REST HTTPS interface

The operator can expose an external REST HTTPS interface which can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster. As with the operator's internal REST interface, the external REST interface requires an SSL/TLS certificate and private key that the operator will use as the identity of the external REST interface.

To enable the external REST interface, configure these values in a custom configuration file or on the Helm command line:

* Set `externalRestEnabled` to `true`.
* Set `externalRestIdentitySecret` to the name of the Kubernetes `tls secret` that contains the certificates and private key.
  For more information about the REST identity secret, see [Updating operator external certificates](#updating-operator-external-certificates).
* Optionally, set `externalRestHttpsPort` to the external port number for the operator REST interface (defaults to `31001`).

**Note**: A node port is a security risk because the port may be publicly exposed to the Internet in some environments. If you need external access to the REST port, then consider alternatives, such as providing access through your load balancer or using Kubernetes port forwarding.

### Updating operator external certificates

If the operator needs to update the external certificate and key currently
being used or was installed without an external REST API SSL/TLS identity,
then use the `helm upgrade` command to restart the operator
with the new or updated Kubernetes `tls secret` that contains
the desired certificates.

The operator _requires_ a restart to begin using the new or updated external
certificate. Use the Helm `--recreate-pods` flag to cause the existing
Kubernetes Pod to be terminated and a new pod to be started with the updated configuration.

For example, if the operator was installed with the Helm release name `weblogic-operator`
in the namespace `weblogic-operator-ns` and the Kubernetes `tls secret` is named
`weblogic-operator-cert`, then you can use the following commands to update the operator
certificates and key:

```shell
$ kubectl create secret tls weblogic-operator-cert -n weblogic-operator-ns \
  --cert=<path-to-certificate> --key=<path-to-private-key>
```

```shell
$ helm get values weblogic-operator -n weblogic-operator-ns
```
```shell
$ helm -n weblogic-operator-ns upgrade weblogic-operator weblogic-operator/weblogic-operator \
  --wait --recreate-pods --reuse-values \
  --set externalRestEnabled=true \
  --set externalRestIdentitySecret=weblogic-operator-cert
```

* [Sample to create external certificate and key]({{<relref "/samples/rest/_index.md#sample-to-create-certificate-and-key">}})


### Use the operator's REST services

You can access most of the REST services using `GET`, for example:

* To obtain a list of domains, send a `GET` request to the URL `/operator/latest/domains`
* To obtain a list of clusters in a domain, send a `GET` request to the URL `/operator/latest/domains/<domainUID>/clusters`

All of the REST services require authentication.  Callers must pass in a valid token header and must have a properly configured CA certificate in their trust store, so that the X.509 certificate presented by the server is trusted by the client (see [How to add your certificate to your operating system trust store](#how-to-add-your-certificate-to-your-operating-system-trust-store)).  In previous operator versions, the operator performed checks using the Kubernetes token review and subject access review APIs, and then updated the Domain resource using the operator's privileges.  Now, by default, the operator will use the caller's bearer token to perform the underlying update to the Domain resource using the caller's privileges and thus delegating authentication and authorization checks directly to the Kubernetes API Server (see [REST interface configuration]({{< relref "/managing-operators/using-helm#rest-interface-configuration" >}})). Depending on your Kubernetes cluster authentication and authorization configuration, there are multiple ways of getting a valid token. For an example using a Kubernetes service account, see the [Sample operator REST client script](#sample-operator-rest-client-script).


{{% notice note %}}
When using the operator's REST services to scale up or down a WebLogic cluster, you may need to grant `patch` access to the user or service account associated with the caller's bearer token. This can be done with an RBAC ClusterRoleBinding between the user or service account and the ClusterRole that defines the permissions for the WebLogic `domains` resource. For more information, see [Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
{{% /notice %}}

Callers should pass in the `Accept:/application/json` header.

To protect against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, the operator REST API requires that you send in a `X-Requested-By` header when you invoke a REST endpoint that makes a change (for example, when you POST to the `/scale` endpoint).  The value is an arbitrary name such as `MyClient`. For example, when using `curl`:

```shell
$ curl ... -H X-Requested-By:MyClient ... -X POST .../scaling
```

If you do not pass in the `X-Requested-By` header, then you'll get a 400 (bad request) response without any details explaining why the request is bad.
The `X-Requested-By` header is not needed for requests that only read, for example, when you GET any of the operator's REST endpoints.

Before using the [Sample operator REST client script](#sample-operator-rest-client-script), you must:

* Update it to ensure that it has the correct service account, namespaces, and such, and it points to the `values.yaml` file
  that you used to install the operator (so that it can get the certificates).
* Add your operator's certificate to your operating system's trust store (see [How to add your certificate to your operating system trust store](#how-to-add-your-certificate-to-your-operating-system-trust-store)).
* If you are using a self-signed certificate and your client is macOS, you may need to update the version of `curl`
  you have installed (though newer versions of macOS come with newer versions of `curl`). Oracle
  recommends `curl 7.63.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0) libcurl/7.63.0 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.11` or later. If you are unsure, then check with `curl --version`.

#### How to add your certificate to your operating system trust store

For macOS, find the certificate in Finder, and double-click on it.  This will add it to your keystore and open Keychain
Access.  Find the certificate in Keychain Access and double-click on it to open the details.  Open the **Trust** drop-down menu and set the value of **When using this certificate** to **Always Trust**, then close the detail window. Enter your password when prompted.

For Oracle Linux, run the following script once to copy the certificate into `/tmp/operator.cert.pem`, and then run these
commands to add the certificate to the trust store:

```shell
$ sudo cp /tmp/operator.cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
```
```shell
$ sudo update-ca-trust enable; sudo update-ca-trust extract
```
```shell
$ openssl x509 -noout -hash -in /tmp/operator.cert.pem
```
```shell
$ sudo ln -s /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/operator.cert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/e242d2da.0
```
In the final command, the file name `e242d2da.0` should be the output of the previous command plus the suffix `.0`.

For other operating systems, consult your operating system's documentation (or Google).

#### Sample SSL certificate and private key for the REST interface

For testing purposes, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator project provides a [sample script]({{<relref "/samples/rest/_index.md#sample-to-create-certificate-and-key">}})
that generates a self-signed certificate and private key for the operator external REST interface.
The generated certificate and key are stored in a Kubernetes `tls secret` and the sample
script outputs the corresponding configuration values in YAML format. These values can be added to your
custom YAML configuration file, for use when the operator's Helm chart is installed. For more detailed information about the sample script and how to run it, see
the [Sample to create certificate and key]({{<relref "/samples/rest/_index.md#sample-to-create-certificate-and-key">}}).

{{% notice warning %}}
The sample script should ***not*** be used in a production environment because
typically a self-signed certificate for external communication is not considered safe.
A certificate signed by a commercial certificate authority is more widely accepted and
should contain valid host names, expiration dates, and key constraints.

### Sample operator REST client script

Here is a small, sample BASH script that may help to prepare the necessary token, certificates, and such, to call the
operator's REST services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
KUBERNETES_SERVER=$1
URL_TAIL=$2

REST_PORT=`kubectl get services -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name == "external-weblogic-operator-svc")].spec.ports[?(@.name == "rest")].nodePort}'`
REST_ADDR="https://${KUBERNETES_SERVER}:${REST_PORT}"
SECRET=`kubectl get serviceaccount weblogic-operator -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}'`
ENCODED_TOKEN=`kubectl get secret ${SECRET} -n weblogic-operator -o jsonpath='{.data.token}'`
TOKEN=`echo ${ENCODED_TOKEN} | base64 --decode`
OPERATOR_CERT_DATA=`kubectl get secret -n weblogic-operator weblogic-operator-external-rest-identity -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}'`
OPERATOR_CERT_FILE="/tmp/operator.cert.pem"
echo ${OPERATOR_CERT_DATA} | base64 --decode > ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE}
cat ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE}

echo "Ready to call operator REST APIs"

STATUS_CODE=`curl \
  -v \
  --cacert ${OPERATOR_CERT_FILE} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H Accept:application/json \
  -X GET ${REST_ADDR}/${URL_TAIL} \
  -o curl.out \
  --stderr curl.err \
  -w "%{http_code}"`

cat curl.err
cat curl.out | jq .
```

{{% notice note %}}
You can use the `-k` option to bypass the check to verify that the operator's certificate is trusted (instead of `curl --cacert`), but this is insecure.

To use this script, pass in the Kubernetes server address and then the URL you want to call.   The script assumes `jq` is installed and uses it to format the response.  This can be removed if desired. In addition to the response, the script also prints out quite a bit of useful debugging information.  Here is an example of the output of this script:

```shell
$ ./rest.sh kubernetes001 operator/latest/domains/domain1/clusters
Ready to call operator REST APIs
