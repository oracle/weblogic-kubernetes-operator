{{< table_of_contents >}}

### Introduction

The operator requires Helm for its installation and tuning,
and this document is a reference guide for useful Helm commands and operator configuration values.

This document assumes that the operator has been installed using an operator Helm chart.
An operator Helm chart can be obtained from the chart repository or can be found in the operator source.
For information about operator Helm chart access, installation, and upgrade,
see [Prepare for installation]({{< relref "/managing-operators/preparation.md" >}})
and [Installation and upgrade]({{< relref "/managing-operators/installation.md" >}}).

### Useful Helm operations

- You can find out the configuration values that the operator Helm chart supports,
  as well as the default values, using the `helm show` command.
    - First, access the operator Helm chart repository using
    this format, `helm repo add <helm-chart-repo-name> <helm-chart-repo-url>`:
      ```text
      $ helm repo add weblogic-operator https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/charts --force-update
      ```
    - Then, use the `helm show` command with this format: `helm show <helm-chart-repo-name>/weblogic-operator`. For example,
      with an operator Helm chart where the repository is named `weblogic-operator`:
      ```text
      $ helm show chart weblogic-operator/weblogic-operator
      ```
- An installed operator is maintained by a Helm release. List the Helm releases for a specified namespace or all namespaces:
  ```shell
  $ helm list --namespace <namespace>
  ```

  ```shell
  $ helm list --all-namespaces
  ```

- Get the status of the operator Helm release named `sample-weblogic-operator`:
  ```shell
  $ helm status sample-weblogic-operator --namespace <namespace>
  ```

- Show the history of the operator Helm release named `sample-weblogic-operator`:
  ```shell
  $ helm history sample-weblogic-operator --namespace <namespace>
  ```

- Roll back to a previous version of the operator Helm release named `sample-weblogic-operator`, in this case, the first version:
  ```shell
  $ helm rollback sample-weblogic-operator 1 --namespace <namespace>
  ```

- Show the custom values you configured for a operator Helm release named `sample-weblogic-operator`:
  ```shell
  $ helm get values sample-weblogic-operator
  ```

- Show all of the values your operator Helm release named `sample-weblogic-operator` is using:
  ```shell
  $ helm get values --all sample-weblogic-operator
  ```

- Change one or more values using `helm upgrade`, for example:
  ```shell
  $ helm repo add weblogic-operator https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/charts --force-update
  $ helm upgrade \
    weblogic-operator/weblogic-operator \
    --reuse-values \
    --set "domainNamespaces={sample-domains-ns1}" \
    --set "javaLoggingLevel=FINE" \
    --wait
  ```
  **Notes**:
  - In this example, the `--reuse-values` flag indicates that previous overrides of other values should be retained.
  - Before changing the `javaLoggingLevel` setting,
    consult the [Operator logging level]({{< relref "/managing-operators/troubleshooting#operator-and-conversion-webhook-logging-level" >}}) advice.


### Operator Helm configuration values

This section describes the details of the operator Helm chart's available configuration values.

#### Overall operator information

##### `serviceAccount`
Specifies the name of the service account in the operator's namespace that the operator will use to make requests to the Kubernetes API server. You are responsible for creating the service account.

The `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command with a non-existing service account results in a Helm chart validation error.

Defaults to `default`.

Example:
```yaml
serviceAccount: "weblogic-operator"
```

##### `kubernetesPlatform`
Specify the Kubernetes platform on which the operator is running. This setting has no default, the only valid value is OpenShift; the setting should be left unset for other platforms.

When set to `OpenShift`, the operator:
- Sets the domain home file permissions in each WebLogic Server pod to work correctly in OpenShift for [Model in Image]({{< relref "/samples/domains/model-in-image/_index.md" >}}), and [Domain home in Image]({{< relref "/samples/domains/domain-home-in-image/_index.md" >}}) domains. Specifically, it sets file group permissions so that they match file user permissions.
- Sets the `weblogic.SecureMode.WarnOnInsecureFileSystem` Java system property to `false` on the command line of each WebLogic Server. This flag suppresses insecure file system warnings reported in the WebLogic Server console when the WebLogic Server is in production mode. These warnings result from setting the file permissions necessary to work with restricted security context constraints on OpenShift.

For more information about the security requirements for running WebLogic in OpenShift, see the [OpenShift]({{<relref "/security/openshift.md">}}) documentation.

Example:
```yaml
kubernetesPlatform: OpenShift
```

##### `enableClusterRoleBinding`
Specifies whether the roles necessary for the operator to manage domains
will be granted using a ClusterRoleBinding rather than using RoleBindings in each managed namespace.

Defaults to `true`.

This option greatly simplifies managing namespaces when the selection is done using label selectors or
regular expressions as the operator will already have privilege in any namespace.

Customers who deploy the operator in Kubernetes clusters that run unrelated workloads will likely
_not_ want to use this option. With the `enableClusterRoleBinding` option, the operator will have
privilege in _all_ Kubernetes namespaces. If you want to limit the operator's privilege to just the set of namespaces that it will manage,
then remove this option; this will mean that the operator has privilege only in the set of namespaces that match the selection strategy
at the time the Helm release was installed or upgraded.

**Note:** If your operator Helm `enableClusterRoleBinding` configuration value is `false`,
then a running operator will _not_ have privilege to manage a newly added namespace
that matches its namespace selection criteria until you upgrade
the operator's Helm release.
See [Ensuring the operator has permission to manage a namespace]({{< relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management#ensuring-the-operator-has-permission-to-manage-a-namespace" >}}).

#### Creating the operator pod

##### `image`
Specifies the container image containing the operator code.

Defaults to `ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:{{< latestVersion >}}`
or similar (based on the default in your Helm chart, see `helm show`
in [Useful Helm operations](#useful-helm-operations)).

Example:
```yaml
image:  "ghcr.io/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:some-tag"
```

##### `imagePullPolicy`
Specifies the image pull policy for the operator container image.

Defaults to `IfNotPresent`.

When using the default images, `IfNotPresent` is sufficient because the
operator will never update an existing image. However, if you have created your own operator image and are
updating the image without changing the tag, you might want to use `Always`.

Example:
```yaml
image:  "Always"
```

##### `imagePullSecrets`
Contains an optional list of Kubernetes Secrets, in the operator's namespace, that are needed to access the registry containing the operator image.
For example, you might need an operator `imagePullSecret` if you are using an operator image from a private registry that requires authentication to pull.
You are responsible for creating the secret. If no secrets are required, then omit this property. For more information on specifying the registry
credentials when the operator image is stored in a private registry, see
[Customizing operator image name, pull secret, and private registry]({{<relref "/managing-operators/preparation#customizing-operator-image-name-pull-secret-and-private-registry">}}).

Examples:
- Using YAML:
  ```yaml
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: "my-image-pull-secret"
  ```
- Using the Helm command line:
  ```
  --set "imagePullSecrets[0].name=my-image-pull-secret"
  ```

##### `annotations`
Specifies a set of key-value annotations that will be added to each pod running the operator. If no customer defined annotations are required, then omit this property.

Example:
```yaml
annotations:
  stage: production
```

You may also specify annotations [using the `--set` parameter to the Helm install command](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing), as follows:

```
--set annotations.stage=production
```

##### `labels`
Specifies a set of key-value labels that will be added to each pod running the operator. The Helm chart will automatically add any required labels, so the customer is not required to define those here. If no customer defined labels are required, then omit this property.

Example:
```yaml
labels:
  sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
```

You may also specify labels [using the `--set` parameter to the Helm install command](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing), as follows:

```
--set labels."sidecar\.istio\.io/inject"=false
```

##### `nodeSelector`
Allows you to run the operator Pod on a Node whose labels match the specified `nodeSelector` labels. You can use this optional feature if you want the operator Pod to run on a Node with particular labels. For more details, see [Assign Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) in the Kubernetes documentation. This is not required if the operator Pod can run on any Node.

Example:
```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
```

##### `affinity`
Allows you to constrain the operator Pod to be scheduled on a Node with certain labels; it is conceptually similar to `nodeSelector`. `affinity` provides advanced capabilities to limit Pod placement on specific Nodes. For more details, see  [Assign Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity) in the Kubernetes documentation. This is optional and not required if the operator Pod can run on any Node or when using `nodeSelector`.

Example:
```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: nodeType
          operator: In
          values:
          - dev
          - test
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 1
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: another-node-label-key
          operator: In
          values:
          - another-node-label-value
```
##### `runAsUser`
Specifies the UID to run the operator and conversion webhook container processes. If not specified, it defaults to the user specified in the operator's container image.

Example:
```yaml
runAsUser: 1000
```

#### WebLogic domain conversion webhook

The WebLogic domain conversion webhook is automatically installed by default when an operator is installed and uninstalled when an operator is uninstalled. You can optionally install and uninstall it independently by using the operator's Helm chart. For details, see [Install the conversion webhook]({{<relref "/managing-operators/conversion-webhook#install-the-conversion-webhook" >}}) and [Uninstall the conversion webhook]({{<relref "/managing-operators/conversion-webhook#uninstall-the-conversion-webhook" >}}).

**Note:** By default, the conversion webhook installation uses the same [`serviceAccount`](#serviceaccount), [Elastic Stack integration](#elastic-stack-integration), and [Debugging options](#debugging-options) configuration values that are used by the operator installation. If you want to use different `serviceAccount` or `Elastic Stack integration` or `Debugging options` for the conversion webhook, then install the conversion webhook independently by using the following `webhookOnly` configuration value and provide the new value during webhook installation.

##### `webhookOnly`
Specifies whether only the conversion webhook should be installed during the `helm install` and that the operator installation should be skipped. By default, the `helm install` command installs both the operator and the conversion webhook.
If set to `true`, the `helm install` will install _only_ the conversion webhook (and not the operator).

Defaults to `false`.

##### `operatorOnly`
Specifies whether only the operator should be installed during the `helm install` and that the conversion webhook installation should be skipped. By default, the `helm install` command installs both the operator and the conversion webhook.
If set to `true`, the `helm install` will install _only_ the operator (and not the conversion webhook).

Defaults to `false`.

##### `preserveWebhook`
Specifies whether the existing conversion webhook deployment should be preserved (not removed) when the release is uninstalled using `helm uninstall`. By default, the `helm uninstall` removes both the webhook and the operator installation.
If set to `true` in the `helm install` command, then the `helm uninstall` command will not remove the webhook installation. Ignored when `webhookOnly` is set to `true` in the `helm install` command.

Defaults to `false`.

#### WebLogic domain management

The settings in this section determine the namespaces that an operator
monitors for domain resources. For usage,
also see [Namespace management]({{< relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management.md" >}}).

##### `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy`

Specifies how the operator will select the set of namespaces that it will manage.
Legal values are: `List`, `LabelSelector`, `RegExp`, and `Dedicated`:

- If set to `List`, then the operator will manage the set of namespaces listed by the `domainNamespaces` value.
- If set to `LabelSelector`, then the operator will manage the set of namespaces discovered by a list
  of namespaces using the value specified by `domainNamespaceLabelSelector` as a label selector.
- If set to `RegExp`, then the operator will manage the set of namespaces discovered by a list
  of namespaces using the value specified by `domainNamespaceRegExp` as a regular expression matched
  against the namespace names.
- Finally, if set to `Dedicated`, then operator will manage WebLogic domains only in the same namespace
  which the operator itself is deployed, which is the namespace of the Helm release.

**NOTES:**
- Defaults to `List`.
- For more information, see [Choose a domain namespace section strategy]({{<relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management#choose-a-domain-namespace-selection-strategy">}}).

{{% notice note %}}
If your operator Helm `enableClusterRoleBinding` configuration value is `false`, note that any domain namespaces created after operator installation,
requires running `helm upgrade` on the operator to have the operator rescan for domains to manage, even if,
for example, using a `LabelSelector` where the namespace has a matching label. See
[Ensuring the operator has permission to manage a namespace]({{< relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management#ensuring-the-operator-has-permission-to-manage-a-namespace" >}}).  
{{% /notice %}}

##### `domainNamespaces`

Specifies a list of namespaces that the operator manages. The names must be lowercase. You are responsible for creating these namespaces.
The operator will only manage domains found in these namespaces.
This value is required if `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` is `List` and ignored otherwise.

Examples:
- Example 1: In the following configuration, the operator will manage the `default` and `ns1` Kubernetes Namespaces:
  ```yaml
  domainNamespaces:
  - "default"
  - "ns1"
  ```
- Example 2: In the following configuration, the operator will manage `namespace1` and `namespace2`:
  ```yaml
  domainNamespaces: [ "namespace1", "namespace2" ]
  ```
  Note that this is a valid but different YAML syntax for specifying arrays
  in comparison to the previous example.
- Example 3: To specify on the Helm command line:
  ```
  --set "domainNamespaces={namespace1,namespace2}"
  ```

**Notes:**
- Defaults to the `default` namespace.
- You must include the `default` namespace in the list if you want the operator to monitor both the `default` namespace and some other namespaces.
- If you change `domainNamespaces` using a `helm upgrade` command,
  then the new list completely replaces the original list
  (they are not merged).
- For more information,
see [Namespace Management]({{<relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management.md">}}).

##### `domainNamespaceLabelSelector`
Specifies a [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) that will be used when searching for namespaces that the operator will manage.
The operator will only manage domains found in namespaces matching this selector.
This value is required if `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` is `LabelSelector` and ignored otherwise.

Examples:
- Example 1: In the following configuration, the operator will manage namespaces that have the label `weblogic-operator`
  regardless of the value of that label:
  ```yaml
  domainNamespaceLabelSelector: weblogic-operator
  ```
- Example 2: In the following configuration, the operator will manage all namespaces that have the label `environment`,
  but where the value of that label is not `production` or `systemtest`:
  ```yaml
  domainNamespaceLabelSelector: environment notin (production,systemtest)
  ```

**Notes**:
- To specify the previous sample on the Helm command line, escape the equal sign, spaces, and commas as follows:
  ```
  --set "domainNamespaceLabelSelector\=environment\\ notin\\ (production\\,systemtest)"
  ```
- If your operator Helm `enableClusterRoleBinding` configuration value is `false`, then
  a running operator will _not_ have privilege to manage a newly added namespace
  that matches its label selector until you upgrade
  the operator's Helm release.
  See [Ensuring the operator has permission to manage a namespace]({{< relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management#ensuring-the-operator-has-permission-to-manage-a-namespace" >}}).

##### `domainNamespaceRegExp`
Specifies a regular expression that will be used when searching for namespaces that the operator will manage.
The operator will only manage domains found in namespaces matching this regular expression.
This value is required if `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` is `RegExp` and ignored otherwise.

**Notes:**

- The regular expression functionality included with Helm is restricted to linear time constructs and,
  in particular, does not support lookarounds. The operator, written in Java, supports these
  complicated expressions. If you need to use a complex regular expression, then either:
     - Set `enableClusterRoleBinding` to `true`.
        - When `enableClusterRoleBinding` is `false`  and namespaces are determined by list or regular expression,
          then the Helm chart has to iterate all of the namespaces and determine which ones match.
        - If you set `enableClusterRoleBinding` to `true` when selecting namespaces by list or regular expression,
          then the Helm chart doesn't need to do anything special per namespace.
     - Or, create the necessary RoleBindings outside of Helm.
- If your operator Helm `enableClusterRoleBinding` configuration value is `false`,
  then a running operator will _not_ have privilege to manage a newly added namespace
  that matches its regular expression until you upgrade
  the operator's Helm release.
  See [Ensuring the operator has permission to manage a namespace]({{< relref "/managing-operators/namespace-management#ensuring-the-operator-has-permission-to-manage-a-namespace" >}}).

##### `introspectorJobNameSuffix` and `externalServiceNameSuffix`
Specify the suffixes that the operator uses to form the name of the Kubernetes job for the domain introspector, and the name of the external service for the WebLogic Administration Server, if the external service is enabled.

Defaults to `-introspector` and `-ext`, respectively. The values cannot be more than 25 and 10 characters, respectively.

{{% notice note %}}
Prior to the operator 3.1.0 release, the suffixes are hard-coded to `-introspect-domain-job` and `-external`. The defaults are shortened in newer releases to support longer names in the domain resource and WebLogic domain configurations, such as the `domainUID`, and WebLogic cluster and server names.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
To work with Kubernetes limits to resource names, the resultant names for the domain introspector job and the external service should not be more than 63 characters. For more details, see [Meet Kubernetes resource name restrictions]({{< relref "/managing-domains/manage-domains#meet-kubernetes-resource-name-restrictions" >}}).
{{% /notice %}}

##### `clusterSizePaddingValidationEnabled`
Specifies if the operator needs to reserve additional padding when validating the server service names to account for longer Managed Server names as a result of expanding a cluster's size in WebLogic domain configurations.

Defaults to `true`.

If `clusterSizePaddingValidationEnabed` is set to `true`, two additional characters will be reserved if the configured cluster's size is between one and nine, and one additional character will be reserved if the configured cluster's size is between 10 and 99. No additional character is reserved if the configured cluster's size is greater than 99.

##### `istioLocalhostBindingsEnabled`

Default for the domain resource `domain.spec.configuration.istio.localhostBindingsEnabled` setting.

For more information, see [Configuring the domain resource]({{< relref "/managing-domains/accessing-the-domain/istio/istio#configuring-the-domain-resource" >}}) in Istio Support.

#### Elastic Stack integration

The following settings are related to integrating the Elastic Stack with the operator pod.

For example usage, see the operator [Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)]({{<relref "/samples/elastic-stack/operator/_index.md#elastic-stack-per-operator-configuration">}}) integration sample.

##### `elkIntegrationEnabled`
Specifies whether or not Elastic Stack integration is enabled.

Defaults to `false`.

Example:
```yaml
elkIntegrationEnabled:  true
```

##### `logStashImage`
Specifies the container image containing Logstash.  This parameter is ignored if `elkIntegrationEnabled` is `false`.

Defaults to `logstash:6.8.23`.

Example:
```yaml
logStashImage:  "docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.8.23"
```

##### `elasticSearchHost`
Specifies the hostname where Elasticsearch is running. This parameter is ignored if `elkIntegrationEnabled` is `false`.

Defaults to `elasticsearch.default.svc.cluster.local`.

Example:
```yaml
elasticSearchHost: "elasticsearch2.default.svc.cluster.local"
```

##### `elasticSearchPort`
Specifies the port number where Elasticsearch is running. This parameter is ignored if `elkIntegrationEnabled` is `false`.

Defaults to `9200`.

Example:
```yaml
elasticSearchPort: 9201
```

##### `elasticSearchProtocol`
Specifies the protocol to use for communication with Elasticsearch. This parameter is ignored if `elkIntegrationEnabled` is `false`.

Defaults to `http`.

Example:

```yaml
elasticSearchProtocol: https
```

##### `createLogStashConfigMap`
Specifies whether a ConfigMap named `weblogic-operator-logstash-cm` should be created during `helm install`.
The ConfigMap contains the Logstash pipeline configuration file `logstash.conf` and the Logstash settings file `logstash.yml` for the Logstash container running in the operator pod.
If set to `true`, then a ConfigMap will be created during `helm install` using the `logstash.conf` and `logstash.yml` files in the `kubernetes/samples/charts/weblogic-operator` directory.
Set `createLogStashConfigMap` to `false` if the ConfigMap already exists in the operator's namespace with the Logstash configuration files.
This parameter is ignored if `elkIntegrationEnabled` is `false`.

Defaults to `true`.

Example:
```yaml
createLogStashConfigMap:  false
```

#### REST interface configuration

The REST interface configuration options are advanced settings for configuring the operator's external REST interface.

For usage information, see the operator [REST Services]({{<relref "/managing-operators/the-rest-api.md">}}).

##### `externalRestEnabled`
Determines whether the operator's REST interface will be exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster using a node port.

See also `externalRestHttpsPort` for customizing the port number.

Defaults to `false`.

If set to `true`, you must provide the `externalRestIdentitySecret` property that contains the name of the Kubernetes Secret which contains the SSL certificate and private key for the operator's external REST interface.

Example:
```yaml
externalRestEnabled: true
```

**Note**: A node port is a security risk because the port may be publicly exposed to the internet in some environments. If you need external access to the REST port, then consider alternatives such as providing access through your load balancer, or using Kubernetes port forwarding.

##### `externalRestHttpsPort`
Specifies the node port that should be allocated for the external operator REST HTTPS interface.

Only used when `externalRestEnabled` is `true`, otherwise ignored.

Defaults to `31001`.

Example:
```yaml
externalRestHttpsPort: 32009
```

**Note**: A node port is a security risk because the port may be publicly exposed to the internet in some environments. If you need external access to the REST port, then consider alternatives such as providing access through your load balancer, or using Kubernetes port forwarding.

##### `externalRestIdentitySecret`
Specifies the user supplied secret that contains the SSL/TLS certificate and private key for the external operator REST HTTPS interface. The value must be the name of the Kubernetes `tls` secret previously created in the namespace where the operator is deployed. This parameter is required if `externalRestEnabled` is `true`, otherwise, it is ignored. To create the Kubernetes `tls` secret, you can use the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl create secret tls <secret-name> \
  -n <operator-namespace> \
  --cert=<path-to-certificate> \
  --key=<path-to-private-key>
```

There is no default value.

The Helm installation will produce an error, similar to the following, if `externalRestIdentitySecret` is not specified (left blank) and `externalRestEnabled` is `true`:
```
Error: render error in "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml": template: weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml:9:3: executing "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml"
    at <include "operator.va...>: error calling include: template: weblogic-operator/templates/_validate-inputs.tpl:42:14: executing "operator.validateInputs"

    at <fail $scope.validati...>: error calling fail:
 string externalRestIdentitySecret must be specified
```

Example:
```yaml
externalRestIdentitySecret: weblogic-operator-external-rest-identity
```

##### `externalOperatorCert` ***(Deprecated)***
{{% notice info %}}
Use **`externalRestIdentitySecret`** instead
{{% /notice %}}

Specifies the user supplied certificate to use for the external operator REST HTTPS interface. The value must be a string containing a Base64 encoded PEM certificate. This parameter is required if `externalRestEnabled` is `true`, otherwise, it is ignored.

There is no default value.

The Helm installation will produce an error, similar to the following, if `externalOperatorCert` is not specified (left blank) and `externalRestEnabled` is `true`:
```
Error: render error in "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml": template: weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml:4:3: executing "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml"
  at <include "operator.va...>: error calling include: template: weblogic-operator/templates/_validate-inputs.tpl:53:4: executing "operator.validateInputs"
  at <include "operator.re...>: error calling include: template: weblogic-operator/templates/_utils.tpl:137:6: executing "operator.reportValidationErrors"
  at <fail .validationErro...>: error calling fail: The string property externalOperatorCert must be specified.
```

Example:
```yaml
externalOperatorCert: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUQwakNDQXJxZ0F3S ...
```

##### `externalOperatorKey` ***(Deprecated)***
{{% notice info %}}
Use **`externalRestIdentitySecret`** instead
{{% /notice %}}

Specifies user supplied private key to use for the external operator REST HTTPS interface. The value must be a string containing a Base64 encoded PEM key. This parameter is required if `externalRestEnabled` is `true`, otherwise, it is ignored.

There is no default value.

The Helm installation will produce an error, similar to the following, if `externalOperatorKey` is not specified (left blank) and `externalRestEnabled` is `true`:
```
Error: render error in "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml": template: weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml:4:3: executing "weblogic-operator/templates/main.yaml"
  at <include "operator.va...>: error calling include: template: weblogic-operator/templates/_validate-inputs.tpl:53:4: executing "operator.validateInputs"
  at <include "operator.re...>: error calling include: template: weblogic-operator/templates/_utils.tpl:137:6: executing "operator.reportValidationErrors"
  at <fail .validationErro...>: error calling fail: The string property externalOperatorKey must be specified.
```

Example:
```yaml
externalOperatorKey: QmFnIEF0dHJpYnV0ZXMKICAgIGZyaWVuZGx5TmFtZTogd2VibG9naWMtb3B ...
```

##### `tokenReviewAuthentication`
If set to `true`, `tokenReviewAuthentication` specifies whether the the operator's REST API should:
   * Use Kubernetes token review API for authenticating users.
   * Use Kubernetes subject access review API for authorizing a user's operation (`get`, `list`,
      `patch`, and such) on a resource.
   * Update the domain resource using the operator's privileges.

 If set to `false`, the operator's REST API will use the caller's bearer token for any update
 to the domain resource so that it is done using the caller's privileges.

 Defaults to `false`.

 Example:
 ```yaml
 tokenReviewAuthentication: true
 ```
#### Debugging options

##### `javaLoggingLevel`

Specifies the level of Java logging that should be enabled in the operator. Valid values are:  `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `CONFIG`, `FINE`, `FINER`, and `FINEST`.

Defaults to `INFO`.

Example:
```yaml
javaLoggingLevel:  "FINE"
```

**Note**: Please consult [Operator logging level]({{< relref "/managing-operators/troubleshooting#operator-and-conversion-webhook-logging-level" >}}) before changing this setting.

##### `remoteDebugNodePortEnabled`
Specifies whether or not the operator will start a Java remote debug server on the provided port and suspend execution until a remote debugger has attached.

Defaults to `false`.

Example:
```yaml
remoteDebugNodePortEnabled:  true
```

##### `internalDebugHttpPort`

Specifies the port number inside the Kubernetes cluster for the operator's Java remote debug server.

This parameter is required if `remoteDebugNodePortEnabled` is `true` (default `false`). Otherwise, it is ignored.

Defaults to `30999`.

Example:
```yaml
internalDebugHttpPort:  30888
```

##### `externalDebugHttpPort`
Specifies the node port that should be allocated for the Kubernetes cluster for the operator's Java remote debug server.

This parameter is required if `remoteDebugNodePortEnabled` is `true`. Otherwise, it is ignored.

Defaults to `30999`.

Example:
```yaml
externalDebugHttpPort:  30777
```

**Note**: A node port is a security risk because the port may be publicly exposed to the internet in some environments. If you need external access to the debug port, then consider using Kubernetes port forwarding instead.
