| June 20, 2019      | v2.2.1   | The operator now supports Kubernetes 1.14.0+.  This release is primarily a bug fix release and resolves the following issues: Servers in domains, where the domain home is on a persistent volume, would sometimes fail to start. These failures would be during the introspection phase following a full domain shutdown.  Now, the introspection script better handles the relevant error conditions. Also, now the Domain provides an option to [pre-create Kubernetes Services](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/{{< latestMinorVersion >}}/documentation/domains/Domain.md#server-service) for WebLogic Servers that are not yet running so that the DNS addresses of these services are resolvable.  These services are now created as non-headless so that they have an IP address. |
| June 6, 2019       | v2.2.0   | Added support for FMW Infrastructure domains. WebLogic Server instances are now gracefully shut down by default and shutdown options are configurable. Operator is now built and runs on JDK 11.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| April 4, 2019      | v2.1     | Customers can add init and sidecar containers to generated pods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| January 16, 2019   | v2.0-rc2 | Schema updates are completed, and various bugs fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| December 20, 2018  | v2.0-rc1 | Operator is now installed using Helm charts, replacing the earlier scripts.  The operator now supports the domain home on a persistent volume or in image use cases, which required a redesign of the domain schema.  You can override the domain configuration using configuration override templates.  Now load balancers and ingresses can be independently configured.  You can direct WebLogic logs to a persistent volume or to the pod's log.  Added life cycle support for servers and significantly enhanced configurability for generated pods.  The final v2.0 release will be the initial release where the operator team intends to provide backward compatibility as part of future releases.                                                                                                           |

| May 7, 2018        | v1.0     | Added support for dynamic clusters, the Apache HTTP Server, the Voyager Ingress Controller, and for PV in NFS storage for multi-node environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| April 4, 2018      | v0.2     | Many Kubernetes artifact names and labels have changed. Also, the names of generated YAML files for creating a domain's PV and PVC have changed.  Because of these changes, customers must recreate their operators and domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| March 20, 2018     | v0.1     | Several files and input parameters have been renamed.  This affects how operators and domains are created.

### Change log

#### Operator 4.0.2

* The Helm chart now supports configuring [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for the operator's deployment.
* Domain resource schema now supports `.spec.maxClusterUnavailable`, which is the default value for the maximum number of cluster members that can be temporarily unavailable, such as during a roll.
* Resolved an issue that would prevent Model in Image domains from working correctly when [Secured Production Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/lockd/secure.html#GUID-ADF914EF-0FB6-446E-B6BF-D230D8B0A5B0) is enabled.
* Pods created for WebLogic Server instances that are members of a WebLogic cluster will now include the label `weblogic.clusterObservedGeneration` specifying the `metadata.generation` of the Cluster resource. This is similar to the already existing `weblogic.domainObservedGeneration` label that specifies the observed generation of the Domain resource.
* Schema conversion from "v8" to "v9" Domains now uses shorter name prefixes when converting "v8" style auxiliary images.
* The Helm chart specifies a more compatible `securityContext` for the operator's deployment when the `kubernetesPlatform` value is "OpenShift".
* The Node Manager instance running within the Pod created for each WebLogic Server instance [now supports additional configuration for how often to restart WebLogic before the Pod's liveness probe fails and the Pod is recreated](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/liveness-readiness-probe-customization/#automatic-restart-of-failed-server-instances-by-node-manager).
* Samples and utility scripts now support the environment variables `KUBERNETES_CLI`, which defaults to `kubectl`, and `WLSIMG_BUILDER`, which defaults to `docker`, to make it easier to use these samples and scripts on platforms that use binaries with different names.
* Resolved an issue where a "v8" Domain that used auxiliary images and also configured `logHome` could be converted to a "v9" Domain that was invalid.
* Resolved an issue where Domains that had a `.spec.domainUid` that was different from the value of `.metadata.name` would not start.

#### Operator 4.0.1

* Resolved an issue where introspection would fail because the function `wlsVersionEarlierThan` was missing.

#### Operator 4.0.0

##### Major Themes

* Auxiliary Image simplification:
  * The usage of Model in Image
    [auxiliary images]({{< relref "/managing-domains/model-in-image/auxiliary-images.md" >}})
    has been substantially simplified.
  * In most cases, customers now need only specify the name of the auxiliary image.

* New Cluster resource:
  * The operator now provides a new custom resource, [Cluster]({{< relref "/managing-domains/domain-resource.md" >}}), which configures a specific WebLogic cluster and provides status information for that cluster.
  * This resource can be used with [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) or similar technologies to scale WebLogic clusters.

* Status and Events updates:
  * The [Conditions]({{< relref "/managing-domains/accessing-the-domain/status-conditions.md" >}}) and [Events]({{< relref "/managing-domains/accessing-the-domain/domain-events.md" >}}) generated about Domain and Cluster resources have been significantly updated.
  * The operator more clearly communicates when the domain or individual clusters have reached the intended state or significant availability for your application workloads.
  * Failures are distinguished between those that require customer intervention and those that are potentially temporary and will be retried.

* Retry updates:
  * The operator handling of
    [retries after a failure]({{< relref "/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/retry.md" >}})
    have been significantly updated.
  * Customers can now tune retry intervals and limits, or disable retries, on a per domain basis.
  * The time of the first failure, last retry, and the expected time of the next retry can now be easily inferred from Domain resource `.status`.

* Istio compatibility:
  * Domain configurations are always compatible with [Istio]({{< relref "/managing-domains/accessing-the-domain/istio/istio.md" >}}) and other service mesh products.
  * Customers are no longer required to enable this support.

##### Upgrade Notes

* This release introduces a new API version for the Domain resource, `weblogic.oracle/v9`.
  * The previous API version, `weblogic.oracle/v8` introduced with Operator 3.0.0 is deprecated, but is still supported.

* This release also introduces a new custom resource, the `weblogic.oracle/v1` Cluster resource.
  * This Cluster resource configures a specific WebLogic cluster and allows customers to scale that cluster using the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) or similar technologies.
  * The Cluster resource `.spec` schema is similar to and replaces the former `weblogic.oracle/v8` Domain resource `.spec.clusters[*]` content.
  * The Cluster resource `.status` schema mirrors the content of the Domain resource `.status.clusters[*]` content.

* This release simplifies [upgrading the operator]({{< relref "/managing-operators/installation.md" >}}).
  * The operator added a [schema conversion webhook]({{< relref "/managing-operators/conversion-webhook.md" >}}).
    * This webhook automates the upgrade of `weblogic.oracle/v8` Domain resources to `weblogic.oracle/v9`.
    * Customers do not need to take any action to begin using the latest Domain schema; however, the team recommends starting with "v9" Domain resources for any new projects.
  * Customers who install a single WebLogic Kubernetes Operator per Kubernetes cluster (most common use case) can upgrade directly from any 3.x operator release to 4.0.0. The Helm chart for 4.0.0 will automatically install the schema conversion webhook.
  * For those customers who install more than one WebLogic Kubernetes Operator in a single Kubernetes cluster:
    * You must upgrade every operator to at least version 3.4.1 before upgrading any operator to 4.0.0.
    * As the 4.0.0 Helm chart now also installs a singleton schema conversion webhook that is shared by all 4.0.0 operators in the cluster,
      you will want to use the `webhookOnly` Helm chart option to install this webhook in its own namespace prior
      to installing any of the 4.0.0 operators,
      and also use the `preserveWebhook` Helm chart option with each operator to prevent an operator uninstall from uninstalling the shared webhook.
  * The operator provides a utility that can be used to convert existing "v8" Domain YAML files to "v9".
  * Several [Helm chart default values have been changed]({{< ref "#changes-to-operator-helm-chart-configuration-values" >}}). Customers who upgrade their 3.x installations using the `--reuse-values` option during the Helm upgrade will continue to use the values from their original installation.

##### Changes to domain schema

* Model in Image auxiliary image related.
  * Added `.spec.configuration.model.auxiliaryImages` for simplified configuration of auxiliary images.
  * Added several additional advanced settings related to auxiliary images including `.spec.configuration.model.auxiliaryImageVolumeMountPath`, `.spec.configuration.model.auxiliaryImageVolumeMedium`, and `.spec.configuration.model.auxiliaryImageVolumeSizeLimit`.
  * Removed `.spec.serverPod.auxiliaryImages` and `.spec.auxiliaryImageVolumes` as part of the simplification effort.
  * Default change for `domain.spec.configuration.model.wdtInstallHome` to `/aux/weblogic-deploy` if `spec.configuration.model.AuxiliaryImages` are specified, and to `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy` otherwise. It previously always defaulted to `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.
  * Default change for `domain.spec.configuration.model.wdtModelHome` to `/aux/models` if `spec.configuration.model.AuxiliaryImages` are specified, and to `/u01/wdt/models` otherwise. It previously always defaulted to `/u01/wdt/models`. 

* Cluster changes.
  * Moved content under `.spec.clusters[*]` to the new Cluster resource `.spec`.
  * Modified `.spec.clusters[*]` to be a list of Cluster resource names.
  * Removed `allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize` field from `.spec.` and `.spec.clusters[*]` as cluster minimums must now be configured through autoscaling.

* Retry and failure tuning related.
  * Added `.spec.failureRetryIntervalSeconds` and `.spec.failureRetryLimitMinutes` for configuration of failure retry timing.
  * Added `.spec.serverPod.maxReadyWaitTimeSeconds` for configuring maximum time before considering servers as stalled during startup.

* Condition status updates.
  * Added or updated Conditions to clearly reflect the current state of the domain:
    * The `Completed` condition is set to `True` when no failures are detected, plus all expected pods are `ready`, at their target image(s), `restartVersion`, and `introspectVersion`.
    * The `Available` condition is set to `True` when a sufficient number of pods are `ready`. This condition can be `True` even when `Completed` is `False`, a `Failed` condition is reported, or a cluster has up to `cluster.spec.maxUnavailable` pods that are not `ready`.
    * The `Failed` condition is set to `True` and its `.message` field is updated when there is a failure.
  * Added `.status.conditions[*].severity` to describe the severity of conditions that represent failures or warnings.
  * Added fields `.status.initialFailureTime` and `.status.lastFailureTime` to enable measuring how long a `Failure` condition has been reported.
  * Removed condition `ServersReady`. Instead use `Available` or `Completed`.
  * Removed condition `Progressing`. Instead:
    * Check `Completed` is `True` to see when a Domain is fully up-to-date and running.
    * Check whether `Available` or `Completed` exist to verify that the operator has noticed the Domain resource.
    * If `Failed` is `True`, then check its `.message` and `.severity` to see if retries have stopped.

* General status updates.
  * Added `.status.observedGeneration` for comparison to `.metadata.generation`; if the two values match, then the status correctly reflects the status of the latest updates to the Domain resource.
  * Renamed `.status.lastIntrospectJobProcessedUid` to `.status.failedIntrospectionUid`.
  * Added `.status.serverStatus[*].podReady` and `.status.serverStatus[*].podPhase` with additional information about the pod associated with each WebLogic Server instance.

* Miscellaneous changes.
  * Added `.spec.logHomeLayout` for configuring the directory layout for WebLogic Server logs.
  * Added `.spec.serverPod.shutdown.waitForAllSessions` to enhance the configuration of server shutdown options.
  * Removed `.spec.configuration.istio` as this section is no longer required.
  * Removed previously deprecated fields `.spec.domainHomeInImage`, `.spec.configOverrides`, and `.spec.configOverrideSecrets`.
    These have been replaced with `.spec.domainHomeSourceType`, `.spec.configuration.overridesConfigMap`, and `.spec.configuration.secrets`.
  * Removed `serverStartState` field from `.spec`, `.spec.adminServer`, `.spec.managedServers[*]`, and `spec.clusters[*]` as this field is no longer needed.
  * Default change for `.spec.adminServer.adminChannelPortForwardingEnabled` to `true`. It previously defaulted to `false`.

##### Changes to operator Helm chart configuration values

* Changed defaults for configuration values.
  * The default for `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` is now `LabelSelector`. It was previously `List`.
  * The default for `domainNamespaceLabelSelector` is now `weblogic-operator=enabled`. It was previously unspecified.
  * The default for `enableClusterRoleBinding` is now `true`; however, this value is ignored if `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` is `Dedicated`. It was previously `false`.

* Removed configuration value.
  * The previously deprecated value `dedicated` has been removed. Set the `domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy` to `Dedicated` instead.

* New configuration values.
  * Added value `createLogStashConfigMap`, default `true`, that configures how an optional Logstash container for the operator is configured.
  * Added value `webhookOnly`, default `false`, that specifies if this Helm release will install only the schema conversion webhook.
  * Added value `operatorOnly`, default `false`, that specifies if this Helm release will install only the operator.
  * Added value `preserveWebhook`, default to `false`, that specifies if the schema conversion webhook should be orphaned when this Helm release is uninstalled.
  * Added value `webhookDebugHttpPort`, default `31999`, that configures an optional debugging port for the webhook.

* Support nodeAffinity and nodeSelector for the operator in its Helm chart ([#1869](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1869)).
* Log file rotation enhancements and documentation ([#1872](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1872), [#1827](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1827)).
* Production support for the NGINX ingress controller ([#1878](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1878)).
* Prevent unnecessary changes to Domain status that were causing churn to the resourceVersion ([#1879](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1879)).
* Better reflect introspector status in the Domain status ([#1832](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1832)).
* Create each pod after any previous pods have been scheduled to allow for correct anti-affinity behavior ([#1855](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1855)).

#### Operator 3.0.1

* Resolved an issue where a Helm upgrade was incorrectly removing the operator's private key thereby disabling the operator's REST interface ([#1846](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1846)).
