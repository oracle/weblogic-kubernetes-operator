##### Oracle Container Registry

You will need an Oracle account. The following steps will direct you to accept the license agreement for WebLogic Server.  Make note of your Oracle Account password and email.  This sample pertains to 12.2.1.4, but other versions may work as well.

  - In a web browser, navigate to https://container-registry.oracle.com and log in using the Oracle Single Sign-On authentication service. If you do not already have SSO credentials, at the top of the page, click the **Sign In** link to create them.
  - The Oracle Container Registry provides a WebLogic 12.2.1.4 General Availability (GA) installation image that is used in this sample.
  - **NOTE**: General Availability (GA) images are suitable for demonstration and development purposes _only_ where the environments are not available from the public Internet; they are **not
     acceptable for production use**. In production, you should always use CPU (patched) images
     from the OCR
     or create your images using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-image-tool/userguide/tools/create-image/)
     (WIT) with the `--recommendedPatches` option. For more guidance,
     see [Apply the Latest Patches and Updates](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/middleware/standalone/weblogic-server/14.1.1.0&id=LOCKD-GUID-2DA84185-46BA-4D7A-80D2-9D577A4E8DE2)
     in _Securing a Production Environment for Oracle WebLogic Server_.
  - Ensure that Docker is running.  Find and then pull the WebLogic 12.2.1.4 installation image:
     ```shell
     $ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4
     ```

   If you have problems accessing the Oracle Container Registry, you can build your own images from the [Oracle GitHub repository](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleWebLogic/dockerfiles).
