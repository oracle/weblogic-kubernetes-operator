Defaults to `Image`, unless `configuration.model` is set, in which case the default is `FromModel`. |
| `domainUID` | string | Domain unique identifier. It is recommended that this value be unique to assist in future work to identify related domains in active-passive scenarios across data centers; however, it is only required that this value be unique within the namespace, similarly to the names of Kubernetes resources. This value is distinct and need not match the domain name from the WebLogic domain configuration. Defaults to the value of `metadata.name`. |

Repeating introspection is required for the operator to recognize changes to the domain configuration, such as adding a new WebLogic cluster or Managed Server instance, to regenerate configuration overrides, or to regenerate the WebLogic domain home when the `domainHomeSourceType` is `FromModel`. Introspection occurs automatically, without requiring change to this field, when servers are first started or restarted after a full domain shut down. For the `FromModel` `domainHomeSourceType`, introspection also occurs when a running server must be restarted because of changes to any of the fields listed here: https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup/#properties-that-cause-servers-to-be-restarted. The introspectVersion value must be a valid label value in Kubernetes. See also `domains.spec.configuration.overrideDistributionStrategy`. |

The existing liveness probe script `livenessProbe.sh` will invoke this custom script after the existing script performs its own checks. This element is optional and is for advanced usage only. Its value is not set by default. If the custom script fails with non-zero exit status, then pod will fail the liveness probe and Kubernetes will restart the container. If the script specified by this element value is not found, then it is ignored. |
| `logHome` | string | The directory in a server's container in which to store the domain, Node Manager, server logs, server *.out, introspector .out, and optionally HTTP access log files if `httpAccessLogInLogHome` is true.

Defaults to `ByServers`. |
| `managedServers` | Array of [Managed Server](#managed-server) | Lifecycle options for individual Managed Servers, including Java options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and the ability to explicitly start, stop, or restart a named server instance. The `serverName` field of each entry must match a Managed Server that already exists in the WebLogic domain configuration or that matches a dynamic cluster member based on the server template. |

If specified, the operator will deploy a sidecar container alongside each WebLogic Server instance that runs the exporter. WebLogic Server instances that are already running when the `monitoringExporter` field is created or deleted, will not be affected until they are restarted. When any given server is restarted for another reason, such as a change to the `restartVersion`, then the newly created pod will have the exporter sidecar or not, as appropriate. See https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-monitoring-exporter. |
| `replaceVariablesInJavaOptions` | Boolean | Specifies whether the operator will replace the environment variables in the Java options in certain situations, such as when the JAVA_OPTIONS are specified using a config map. Defaults to false. |
| `replicas` | integer | The default number of cluster member Managed Server instances to start for each WebLogic cluster in the domain configuration, unless `replicas` is specified for that cluster under the `clusters` field. For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come after "managed-server9". The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Servers will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas` count. Defaults to 1. |
