#### Domain lifecycle sample scripts

Beginning in version 3.1.0, the operator provides sample scripts to start up or shut down a specific Managed Server or cluster in a deployed domain, or the entire deployed domain.

**Note**: Prior to running these scripts, you must have previously created and deployed the domain.

The scripts are located in the `kubernetes/samples/scripts/domain-lifecycle` directory. They are helpful when scripting the life cycle of a WebLogic Server domain. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/tree/master/kubernetes/samples/scripts/domain-lifecycle/README.md).
