This documentation is produced using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).  To make an
update to the documentation, follow this process:

1. If you have not already done so, clone the repository.

    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator
    ```

2. Create a new branch.

    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b your-branch
    ```

3. Make your documentation updates by editing the source files in
`documentation/staging/content`.
{{% notice note %}}
Make sure you check in the changes from the `documentation/staging/content` area _only_;
do not build the site and check in the static files.
{{% /notice %}}

4. If you wish to view your changes, you can run the site locally using
these commands. The site will be available on the URL shown here:

    ```shell
    $ cd documentation/staging
    $ hugo server -b http://localhost:1313/weblogic-kubernetes-operator
    ```

5. When you are ready to submit your changes, push your branch to `origin`
and submit a pull request. Remember to follow the guidelines in the
[Contribute to the operator]({{< relref "/developerguide/contributing.md" >}})
document.
