### Overview

The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator populates status conditions on Domain and Cluster resources to provide
high-level status reporting.
Status conditions are a Kubernetes standard mechanism and the conditions generated by the operator
are similar to those that Kubernetes provides for Pod and Deployment resources.

### Checking domain or cluster conditions

Conditions can be found under the `status.conditions` field in a Domain resource or a Cluster resource.

You can check the conditions in a Domain resource by using:
`kubectl -n MY_NAMESPACE describe domain MY_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_NAME`. Similarly, you can check the conditions in a Cluster resource by using:
`kubectl -n MY_NAMESPACE describe cluster MY_CLUSTER_NAME`.

### Attributes in a condition

The following attributes can be found in a condition:
- `type` - The type of the condition, such as `Failed` or `Available`. See [Types of domain status conditions]({{< relref "#types-of-domain-status-conditions">}}).
- `status` - The status of the condition, such as `True` or `False`.
- `message` - An optional, human-readable message providing more details about the condition.
- `reason` - The [reason]({{< relref "managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/retry#domain-failure-reasons" >}}) for the `Failed` condition. Not applicable to other types of condition.
- `severity` - The [severity]({{< relref "managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/retry#domain-failure-severities" >}}) for the `Failed` condition. Not applicable to other types of condition.
- `lastTransitionTime` - A timestamp of when the condition was created or the last time time the condition transitioned from one status to another.

### Types of domain conditions

The following is a list of condition types for a Domain resource.

#### `Failed`

- The desired state of the Domain resource cannot be achieved due to failures encountered in
  processing the Domain resource.
For information about how to diagnose failures, see [debugging]({{< relref "managing-domains/debugging.md" >}}).
- The `status` attribute is always `True` for a `Failed` condition.
  The `Failed` condition is removed from the domain status when the underlying failure is resolved.
- The `message` attribute contains an error message with details of the failure.
- The `reason` attribute is set to one of the reasons listed in [domain failure reasons]({{< relref "managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/retry#domain-failure-reasons" >}}).
- The `severity` attribute is set to one of the severity levels listed in [domain failure severities]({{< relref "managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/retry#domain-failure-severities" >}}).

```
{{% /expand %}}

#### `Completed`
- The `status` attribute of a `Completed` condition indicates whether the desired state of the
  Domain resource has been fully achieved.
- The `status` attribute is set to `True` when all of the following are true:
  * There are no `Failed` conditions, for example, no failures are detected.
  * One of the following conditions are met:
    * All WebLogic Server pods that are expected to be running are `ready` at their target image or images,
      `restartVersion`, and `introspectVersion`.
    * No WebLogic Server pods are running and this is the expected state.
    * The domain is configured to have a `spec.serverStartPolicy` value of `AdminOnly` and the
      Administration Server pod is running and ready.
  * There are no pending server shutdown requests.

#### `Available`
- The `status` attribute is set to `True` when a sufficient number of pods are ready such that
  all of the following are true:
  * At least one WebLogic Server pod is ready.
  * Every non-clustered server with a `serverStartPolicy` value of `IfNeeded` or `Always` is ready.
  * Every Cluster resource referenced by the domain has `True` in its `Available` condition.
    Clusters that are configured with a `replicas` value of `0` or a `serverStartPolicy` value of `Never`
    are ignored.
- **NOTE**: The `Available` `status` can be `True` even when the `status` for the `Completed` condition is `False`,
  a `Failed` condition is reported, or a cluster has up to `cluster.spec.maxUnavailable` pods
  that are not ready.

#### `ConfigChangesPendingRestart`
- This condition tracks the progress of [runtime updates]({{< relref "managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates">}})
  to the WebLogic Deploy Tooling model of a Model in Image domain home source type.
- The `status` attribute is `True` if all of the following are true:
  * The Domain resource attribute
    `domain.spec.configuration.model.onlineUpdate.onNonDynamicChanges` is `CommitUpdateOnly`.
  * The Domain resource attribute
    `domain.spec.configuration.model.onlineUpdate.enabled` is `True`.
  * There were model changes and these changes modify non-dynamic WebLogic configuration.
  * Processing successfully completed, including the introspector job.
  * The administrator has not subsequently rolled or restarted each WebLogic Server pod
    (to propagate the pending non-dynamic changes).
- The `ConfigChangesPendingRestart` condition is removed from the domain status when pending
  non-dynamic runtime updates complete their processing due to a roll or restart.
- For how to see which pods are awaiting restart using WebLogic pod labels, see [Online update status and labels]({{< relref "managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates#online-update-status-and-labels" >}}).

    Type:                        ConfigChangesPendingRestart
```
{{% /expand %}}

#### `Rolling`
- This condition indicates that the operator is rolling the server pods in a domain, such as after it
  has detected an update to the Domain resource or Model in Image model that requires it to
  perform a [rolling restart]({{< relref "managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup#rolling-restarts" >}}) of the domain.
- The `status` attribute is always `True` for a `Rolling` condition.
- The `Rolling` condition is removed from the domain status when the rolling is completed.


### Types of cluster conditions

The following is a list of condition types for a Cluster resource.
#### `Completed` {id="cluster-completed"}
- The `status` attribute of a `Completed` condition indicates whether the desired state of the
  Cluster resource has been fully achieved.
- The `status` attribute is set to `True` when all of the following are true:
  * There are no `Failed` `domain.status.conditions`.
  * No WebLogic Server pods are expected to be running, _or_ all server pods in the cluster that are expected to be running are ready at their target
    image or images, `restartVersion`, and `introspectVersion`
  * There are no pending server shutdown requests.

#### `Available` {id="cluster-available"}
- The `status` attribute is set to `True` when a sufficient number of WebLogic Server pods are
  ready in the cluster. Both of the following must be true:
  - At least one pod in the cluster is expected to run and is `ready`.
  - The number of `not ready` server pods, which are expected to run,
    is less than or equal to the value of `cluster.spec.maxUnavailable`, which defaults to `1`.
- Examples:
  - If a cluster has a `serverStartPolicy` of `Never`, or `replicas` is `0`,
    or a cluster is in a domain with `serverStartPolicy` of `AdminOnly` or `Never`,
    then the cluster will have an `Available` condition that is `False`.
  - If a cluster and domain both have a `serverStartPolicy` of `IfNeeded`,
    and `cluster.spec.replicas` is `1`,
    then the cluster will have an `Available` condition that is `True` only when its single pod is ready.
  - If a cluster and domain both have a `serverStartPolicy` of `IfNeeded`,
    `cluster.spec.replicas` is `4`,
    and `cluster.spec.maxUnavailable` is `1` (the default),
    then the cluster will have an `Available` condition  that is `True` only when three or four of its pods are ready.
- **NOTE**: The `Available` condition's `status` can be `True` even when the `status` for the `Completed`
  condition is `False`, a `Failed` condition is reported on the Domain resource, or the cluster
  has up to `cluster.spec.maxUnavailable` pods that are not ready.

### Conditions life cycle

After the operator detects a Cluster or Domain resource, it will ensure that each resource always has
exactly one occurrence of an `Available` and of a `Completed` condition. The operator will not
subsequently remove these conditions but instead, will change their status to `True` or `False`
as appropriate. You can use this fact as a way to determine when an operator has detected a
Domain or Cluster resource.

The `Failure`, `Rolling`, and `ConfigChangesPendingRestart` conditions are ephemeral; they are only
added when they apply, and are removed when they no longer apply.

The `Failure` condition is the only condition that can have multiple occurrences. This occurs when
there are multiple concurrent failures of different types.

### Conditions and generations

Use `metadata.generation` and `status.observedGeneration` in Domain and Cluster resources
to detect when their conditions and other status are up-to-date. Specifically, conditions may not
be up-to-date when `domain.status.observedGeneration` generation does not equal
`domain.metadata.generation`, or when `cluster.status.observedGeneration` does not equal
`cluster.metadata.generation` in any of the domain's Cluster resources. This may indicate either
the operator is in the process of updating the status or the operator is not running.

### Conditions and events

A corresponding event is generated when an `Available`, `Completed`, `Failure`, or `Rolling`
condition has changed. For details, see [operator-generated event types]({{< relref "managing-domains/accessing-the-domain/domain-events#operator-generated-event-types">}}).
