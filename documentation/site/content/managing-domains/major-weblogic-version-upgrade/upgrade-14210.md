This document provides guidelines for upgrading WLS and FMW/JRF infrastructure domains to v14.1.2.0.

### Important considerations

By default, version 14.1.2.0 WLS and FMW/JRF infrastructure domains _in production mode_ are set to **secured production mode**, in which their default security configuration
is more secure, insecure configurations are logged as warnings, and default authorization and
role mapping policies are more restrictive.

Some important secured production mode changes are:

* Plain HTTP listen ports are disabled.  Any application code, utilities, or ingresses that use plain HTTP listen ports must be changed.

* SSL listen ports must be enabled for every server in the domain.  Each server must have at least one SSL listen port set up, either in the default channel or in one of the custom network channels. Note that demo SSL certificates should **not** be used in a production environment; you should set up SSL listen ports with valid SSL certificates in all server instances.

* Demo SSL certificates have been changed completely from previous releases; there are special considerations when using them.  For more information, see [Using demo SSL certificates in v14.1.2.0.0 or later]({{< relref "/managing-domains/model-in-image/overview#using-demo-ssl-certificates-in-v141200-or-later" >}}).


For more information about secured production mode, see the [secured production mode](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/lockd/secure.html#GUID-ADF914EF-0FB6-446E-B6BF-D230D8B0A5B0) documentation.

**NOTE**: If the domain is _not_ in production mode, then none of the security changes apply.

### General upgrade procedures

In general, the process for upgrading WLS and FMW/JRF infrastructure domains in Kubernetes is similar to upgrading domains on premises. For a thorough understanding, we suggest that you read the [Fusion Middleware Upgrade Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/12.2.1.4/asmas/planning-upgrade-oracle-fusion-middleware-12c.html#GUID-D9CEE7E2-5062-4086-81C7-79A33A200080).

Before the upgrade, you must do the following:

- If your [domain home source type]({{< relref "/managing-domains/choosing-a-model/_index.md" >}}) is Domain on Persistent Volume (DoPV), then back up the domain home.
- If your domain type is `JRF`, then:
   - Back up the JRF database.
   - Back up the OPSS wallet file. See [Save the OPSS wallet secret](#back-up-the-opss-wallet-and-save-it-in-a-secret).
   - Make sure nothing else is accessing the database.
- **Do not delete** the domain resource.
- Shut down the domain by patching the domain and/or cluster spec `serverStartPolicy` to `Never`. For example:
   ```
   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns patch domain sample-domain1 --type=json -p='[ {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/serverStartPolicy", "value": "Never"}]'
   ```


If your domain is on a persistent volume, WebLogic provides two utilities for performing version upgrades of WebLogic domains: the Upgrade Assistant for upgrading FMW JRF database schemas and the Reconfiguration Wizard for upgrading the domain configuration. When running these utilities, you will need access to the existing domain home directory.
Because a typical Kubernetes environment lacks a graphical interface, you must run these utilities with the command-line options.

If your domain is using Model in Image, because the domain will be rebuilt when the model is updated, see the [Upgrade Use Cases](#upgrade-use-cases) for details.

#### Back up the OPSS wallet and save it in a secret

The operator provides a helper script, the [OPSS wallet utility](https://orahub.oci.oraclecorp.com/weblogic-cloud/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/-/blob/main/kubernetes/samples/scripts/domain-lifecycle/opss-wallet.sh), for extracting the wallet file and storing it in a Kubernetes `walletFileSecret`. In addition, you should save the wallet file in a safely backed-up location, outside of Kubernetes. For example, the following command saves the OPSS wallet for the `sample-domain1` domain in the `sample-ns` namespace to a file named `ewallet.p12` in the `/tmp` directory and also stores it in the wallet secret named `sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret`.

```
$ opss-wallet.sh -n sample-ns -d sample-domain1 -s -r -wf /tmp/ewallet.p12 -ws sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret
```

#### Deploy a WebLogic Server pod to access the domain home on a persistent volume

For domain on persistent volume, you will need to access the domain home on the shared volume with the 14.1.2.0 WebLogic Server version pod.
You can launch a running pod with the [PV and PVC helper script](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/main/kubernetes/samples/scripts/domain-lifecycle/pv-pvc-helper.sh).

For example,

```shell
$ ./pv-pvc-helper.sh -n sample-domain1-ns -c sample-domain1-pvc-rwm1 -m /share -i wls14120:fmw
```

After the pod is deployed, you can `kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns exec -it pvhelper -- /bin/sh'` into the pod's terminal session.

#### Upgrade the JRF database

The Upgrade Assistant is for upgrading schemas in a JRF database.  It will detect if any schema needs to be upgraded, then upgrade the schemas and also upgrade the system-owned schema version table.

If you have not yet deployed a WebLogic Server pod, see [Deploy the server pod](#deploy-a-weblogic-server-pod-attaching-a-persistent-volume).

From the `pvhelper` pod, to discover all the command-line options:

```shell
$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/upgrade/bin
$ ./ua -help
```

Create a file named `response.txt` with this content and modify any `<TODO:` to match your environment.

```
# This is a response file for the Fusion Middleware Upgrade Assistant.

####  Reconfigure the domain

The Reconfiguration Wizard will upgrade the domain configuration to the 14.1.2.0 version.

If you have not yet deployed a WebLogic Server pod, see [Deploy the server pod](#deploy-a-weblogic-server-pod-attaching-a-persistent-volume).

From the `pvhelper` pod, use the following WLST commands to reconfigure a domain to the 14.1.2.0 version.


```shell
$ /u01/oracle/oracle_common/bin/wlst.sh

Initializing WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) ...

Welcome to WebLogic Server Administration Scripting Shell

Type help() for help on available commands

wls:/offline> readDomainForUpgrade('<your domain home directory path>')
wls:/offline> updateDomain()
wls:/offline> closeDomain()
```

If there are any errors, you need to correct them or contact Oracle Support for assistance.

### Upgrade use cases

Consider the following use case scenarios, depending on your WebLogic domain type (`WLS` or `JRF`) and domain home source type (Domain on PV or Model in Image).

- [WLS Domain on Persistent Volume](#wls-domain-on-persistent-volume)
- [FMW/JRF Domain on Persistent Volume](#fmwjrf-domain-on-persistent-volume)
- [WLS domain using Model in Image](#wls-domain-using-model-in-image)
- [FMW/JRF domain using Model in Image](#fmwjrf-domain-using-model-in-image)

#### WLS Domain on Persistent Volume

1. Follow the steps in the [General upgrade procedures](#general-upgrade-procedures).  You can skip the database related steps.
2. Upgrade the domain configuration using the reconfiguration WLST commands. See [Reconfigure the domain](#reconfigure-the-domain).
3. Update the domain resource to use the WebLogic 14120 base image, and patch the `serverStartPolicy` to `IfNeeded` to restart the domain.  For example,
   `kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns patch domain sample-domain1 --type=json -p='[ {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/serverStartPolicy", "value": "Never"}, {"op": "replace", "path":"/spec/image", "value":"<WebLogic 14120 base image>"]'`

#### FMW/JRF Domain on Persistent Volume

1. Follow the steps in the [General upgrade procedures](#general-upgrade-procedures).
2. Run the Upgrade Assistant. See [Upgrade the JRF database](#upgrade-the-jrf-database).
3. Upgrade the domain configuration using the reconfiguration WLST commands. See [Reconfigure the domain](#reconfigure-the-domain).
4. Update the domain resource to use the Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 14120 base image, and patch the `serverStartPolicy` to `IfNeeded` to restart the domain.  For example,
   `kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns patch domain sample-domain1 --type=json -p='[ {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/serverStartPolicy", "value": "Never"}, {"op": "replace", "path":"/spec/image", "value":"<Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 14120 image>"]'`


#### WLS domain using Model in Image

1. Follow the steps in the [General upgrade procedures](#general-upgrade-procedures).
2. Depending on whether your existing domain is using secured production mode, use one of the following options.


| Existing Domain                                                                                      | Upgrade Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Domain is already using secured production mode                                                      | Update the domain resource to use the WebLogic 14120 base image and redeploy the domain.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Domain is not using secured production mode but ready to switch to use secured production mode       | Enable secured production mode. See the [Sample WDT YAML](#sample-wdt-model-for-secured-production-mode-and-ssl), update the domain resource to use the WebLogic 14120 base image and redeploy the domain.                                         |
| Domain is not using secured production mode but _not_ ready to switch to use secured production mode | Update the domain resource to use the WebLogic 14120 base image and redeploy the domain, the operator will automatically disable the secured production mode for you, but your domain will not have the added benefits of a secured production mode. |
| Domain is not using secured production mode and wanted to start from scratch to rebuild the domain   | Delete the domain first, enable secure production mode. See the [Sample WDT YAML](#sample-wdt-model-for-secured-production-mode-and-ssl), update the domain resource YAML to use the WebLogic 14120 base image and deploy the domain.              |

3. You can use this patch command for redeploying the domain with the new WebLogic 14120 image.  For example,
   `kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns patch domain sample-domain1 --type=json -p='[ {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/serverStartPolicy", "value": "Never"}, {"op": "replace", "path":"/spec/image", "value":"<WebLogic 14120 base image>"]'`

#### FMW/JRF domain using Model in Image

FMW/JRF domains using Model in Image has been deprecated since WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.1. Before upgrading to FMW v14.1.2.0, we recommend moving your domain home to Domain on Persistent Volume. For more information, see [Domain On Persistent Volume]({{< relref "/managing-domains/domain-on-pv/overview.md" >}}).

1. Follow the steps in the [General upgrade procedures](#general-upgrade-procedures).
2. If are not using an auxiliary image in your domain, then create a [Domain creation image]({{< relref "/managing-domains/domain-on-pv/domain-creation-images.md" >}}).
3. Create a new domain resource YAML file.  You should have at least the following changes:

```
# Change type to PersistentVolume
domainHomeSourceType: PersistentVolume
image: <Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 14120 base image>
...
serverPod:
    ...
    # specify the volume and volume mount information

    volumes:
    - name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: sample-domain1-pvc-rwm1
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /share
      name: weblogic-domain-storage-volume

  # specify a new configuration section, remove the old configuration section.

  configuration:

    # secrets that are referenced by model yaml macros
    # sample-domain1-rcu-access is used for JRF domains
    secrets: [ sample-domain1-rcu-access ]

    initializeDomainOnPV:
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        metadata:
            name: sample-domain1-pvc-rwm1
        spec:
            storageClassName: my-storage-class
            resources:
                requests:
                    storage: 10Gi
      domain:
          createIfNotExists: Domain
          domainCreationImages:
          - image: 'myaux:v6'
          domainType: JRF
          domainCreationConfigMap: sample-domain1-wdt-config-map
          opss:
            # Make sure you have already saved the wallet file secret. This allows the domain to use
            # an existing JRF database schemas.
            walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret
            walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret
```

4. Deploy the domain. If it is successful, then the domain has been migrated to a persistent volume.  Now, you can proceed to upgrade to version 14.1.2.0, see [FMW/JRF domain on PV](#fmwjrf-domain-on-persistent-volume).

### Sample WDT model for secured production mode and SSL

If you are upgrading an existing domain to 14.1.2.0 and your existing domain does not have secured production mode enabled, the operator, by default, will _disable_ secured production mode. If you want to override this behavior, you must enable it explicitly. Optionally, you can delete the existing domain and let the operator completely rebuild the domain and, by default, secured production mode will be enabled; you do not have to enable it explicitly.

The following is a code snippet of a WDT model for setting up secured production mode and SSL.

```
topology:
  # Production mode must be true for secured production mode
  #
  ProductionModeEnabled: true
  SecurityConfiguration:
    # If you are updating an existing, pre 14.1.2.0 domain that does not have secure mode enabled,
    # and want to use secured production mode, make sure you enable secure mode; otherwise the
    # operator will disable it by default.  
    #
    #
    SecureMode:
      SecureModeEnabled: true
    #
    # Make sure SSL is set up in all servers and server templates.
    #
    Server:
        "admin-server":
            CustomTrustKeyStoreFileName: 'wlsdeploy/servers/admin-server/trust-keystore.jks'
            CustomIdentityKeyStoreFileName: 'wlsdeploy/servers/admin-server/identity-keystore.jks'
            KeyStores: CustomIdentityAndCustomTrust
            CustomIdentityKeyStoreType: JKS
            CustomTrustKeyStoreType: JKS           
            CustomIdentityKeyStorePassPhraseEncrypted:            
            CustomTrustKeyStorePassPhraseEncrypted:
            SSL:
                ListenPort: 7002
                Enabled : true            
                ServerPrivateKeyAlias: adminkey
