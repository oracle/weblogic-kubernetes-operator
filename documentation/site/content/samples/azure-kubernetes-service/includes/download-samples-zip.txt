##### Download the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator sample.

Download the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator sample zip. We will use several scripts in this zip file to create a WebLogic domain. This sample was tested with v4.1.7, but should work with the latest release.

```shell
$ cd $BASE_DIR
$ mkdir sample-scripts
$ curl -m 120 -fL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/releases/download/v4.1.7/sample-scripts.zip \
      -o ${BASE_DIR}/sample-scripts/sample-scripts.zip
$ unzip ${BASE_DIR}/sample-scripts/sample-scripts.zip -d ${BASE_DIR}/sample-scripts
```
