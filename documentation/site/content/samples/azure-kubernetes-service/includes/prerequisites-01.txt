#### Prerequisites

This sample assumes the following prerequisite environment.

* If you don't have an [Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
  * It's **strongly** recommended that the Azure identity you use to sign in and complete this article has either the [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role in the current subscription or the [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) and [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) roles in the current subscription. 
  * If your identity has very limited role assignments, ensure you have the following role assignments in the AKS resource group and AKS node resource group.
    * [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role and [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role in the resource group that runs AKS cluster. This requires asking a privileged user to assign the roles before creating resource in the resource group.
    * [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role in the AKS node resource group whose name starts with "MC_". This requires asking a privileged user to assign the role after the AKS instance is created.
* Operating System: GNU/Linux, macOS, or [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install).
   * Note: the Docker image creation steps will not work on a Mac with Apple Silicon.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads); use `git --version` to test if `git` works.  This document was tested with version 2.25.1.
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure); use `az --version` to test if `az` works.  This document was tested with version 2.58.0.
* [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).  This document was tested with `Docker version 20.10.7`.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes-io-vnext-staging.netlify.com/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/); use `kubectl version` to test if `kubectl` works.  This document was tested with version v1.21.2.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), version 3.1 and later; use `helm version` to check the `helm` version.  This document was tested with version v3.6.2.
* A JDK, version 8 or 11. Azure recommends [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/download). Ensure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly in the shells in which you run the commands.
* Ensure that you have the zip/unzip utility installed; use `zip/unzip -v` to test if `zip/unzip` works.
* You will need an Oracle account.
