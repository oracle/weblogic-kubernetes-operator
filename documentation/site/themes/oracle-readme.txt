When the relearn theme was first installed, we made three changes to files inside the theme.  To find these changes,
search for the string "rpatrick" inside the theme directory (currently hugo-theme-relearn-8.3.0).

When installing a new theme or even a new version of the relearn them, you need to edit the top-level config.toml
file to set the following line to point to the new directory:

theme = "hugo-theme-relearn-8.3.0"

Other changes may be required based on the new theme but that is outside the scope of this note.
