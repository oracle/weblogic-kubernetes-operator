The Quick Start guide provides a simple tutorial to help you get the operator up and running quickly. Use this Quick Start guide to create a WebLogic Server deployment in a Kubernetes cluster with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (the "operator"). Please note that this walk-through is for demonstration purposes _only_, not for use in production.
These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes. If you need more detailed instructions, please
refer to [Manage operators]({{< relref "/managing-operators/_index.md" >}}).

For this exercise, youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster. If you need help setting one up, check out our [cheat sheet]({{< relref "/managing-operators/k8s-setup.md" >}}). This guide assumes a Kubernetes cluster with no operator installation.

The operator uses Helm to create and deploy the necessary resources and then run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. For detailed Helm installation and usage information, see the [Configuration reference]({{< relref "/managing-operators/using-helm.md" >}}).

{{% notice note %}}
All Kubernetes distributions and managed services have small differences. In particular, the way that persistent storage and load balancers are managed varies significantly. You may need to adjust the instructions in this guide to suit your particular flavor of Kubernetes.
