### Oracle Slack
We have a closely monitored public Slack channel where you can get
in touch with us to ask questions about using the operator or give us feedback
or suggestions about what features and improvements you would like to see.
We can also create dedicated private channels upon request.
We would love to hear from you.

To join our public channel, please
[visit this site to get an invitation](https://weblogic-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com/).
The invitation email will include
details of how to access our Slack workspace.
After you are logged in, please come to `#operator` and say, "hello!"

### GitHub issues
To quickly get help, we strongly recommend using [Oracle Slack](#oracle-slack).
If this is insufficient, then feel free
to submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/issues) on the
WebLogic Kubernetes Operator project. All issues are public.
