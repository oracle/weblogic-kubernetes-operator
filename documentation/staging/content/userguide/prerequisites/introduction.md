For the current production release 3.2.5:

* Kubernetes 1.16.15+, 1.17.13+, 1.18.10+, 1.19.7+, and 1.20.6+  (check with `kubectl version`).
* Flannel networking v0.9.1-amd64 or later (check with `docker images | grep flannel`), Calico networking v3.16.1 or later,
 *or* OpenShift SDN on OpenShift 4.3 systems.
* Docker 18.9.1 or 19.03.1+ (check with `docker version`) *or* CRI-O 1.20.6+ (check with `crictl version | grep RuntimeVersion`).
* Helm 3.3.4+ (check with `helm version --client --short`).
* For domain home source type `Model in Image`, WebLogic Deploy Tooling 1.9.11.
* Either Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930, Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0, or Oracle WebLogic Server 14.1.1.0.0.
   * The existing WebLogic Server image, `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3`,
   has all the necessary patches applied.
   * Check the WLS version with `docker run container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3 sh -c` `'source $ORACLE_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 && java weblogic.version'`.
   * Check the WLS patches with `docker run container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3 sh -c` `'$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lspatches'`.
* Container images based on Oracle Linux 8 are now supported. The Oracle Container Registry hosts container images
  based on both Oracle Linux 7 and 8, including Oracle WebLogic Server 14.1.1.0.0 images based on Java 8 and 11.
* You must have the `cluster-admin` role to install the operator.  The operator does
  not need the `cluster-admin` role at runtime. For more information, see the role-based access control, [RBAC]({{< relref "/security/rbac.md" >}}), documentation.
* We do not currently support running WebLogic in non-Linux containers.
