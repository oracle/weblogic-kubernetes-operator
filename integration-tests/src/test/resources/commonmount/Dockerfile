# This is a sample Dockerfile for supplying Model in Image model files
# and a WDT installation in a small separate "common mount"
# image. This is an alternative to supplying the files directly
# in the domain resource `domain.spec.image` image.

# COMMON_MOUNT_PATH arg:
#   Parent location for Model in Image model and WDT installation files.
#   Must match domain resource 'domain.spec.commonMountVolumes.mountPath'
#   For model-in-image, the following two domain resource attributes can
#   be a directory in the mount path:
#     1) 'domain.spec.configuration.model.modelHome'
#     2) 'domain.spec.configuration.model.wdtInstallHome'
#   Default '/common'.
