  ## Database image details
  ## Base DB images are available at container-registry.oracle.com or build from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance
  ## Build patched DB images from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/extensions/patching
  ## Prebuilt DB support (https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/extensions/prebuiltdb)
  ## Specify prebuiltDB as true if the image includes a prebuilt DB
  ## If cloning specify an image that is of same major version as the source DB at same or different patch levels
  image:
    pullFrom:
    pullSecrets:
    prebuiltDB: false

  
  ## Database storage details
  ## size is the required minimum size of the persistent volume
  ## storageClass is specified for dynamic volume provisioning and datafilesVolumeName for static provisioning
  persistence:
    ## if the storageClass supports volume expansion, patch the size attribute to expand the volume
    ## Shrinking volumes is not allowed
    size: 100Gi
    ## set ownership/permissions for writing to datafiles volume. This is usually needed for NFS volumes. 
    setWritePermissions: true
    ## oci-bv applies to OCI block volumes. Use "standard" storageClass for dynamic provisioning in Minikube. Update as appropriate for other cloud services
    storageClass: "oci-bv"
    ## accessMode can only accept one of ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany
    accessMode: "ReadWriteOnce"
    ## datafilesVolumeName is optional. Specify for binding to a specific PV and set storageClass to an empty string to disable automatic volume provisioning
    datafilesVolumeName: ""
    ## Optionally specify a volume containing scripts in 'setup' and 'startup' folders to be executed during database setup and startup respectively.
    scriptsVolumeName: ""

  ## Database pod resource details
  ## cpu can be expressed in terms of cpu units and can be a plain integer or fractional value
  ## memory is measured in bytes and can be expressed in plain integer or as a fixed-point number
  ## using one of these quantity suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, k.
  ## You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki.
  resources:
    ## requests denotes minimum node resources required/to be utilized by the database pod
    requests:
      cpu: 
      memory:
    ## limits specifies the maximum node resources that can be utilized by the database pod
    limits: 
      cpu:
      memory:

  ## Type of service . Applicable on cloud enviroments only
  ## if loadBalService : false, service type = "NodePort" else "LoadBalancer"
  loadBalancer: false
  
  ## 'listenerPort' and 'tcpsListenerPort' fields customizes port cofigurations for normal and tcps database listeners
  ## 'tcpsListenerPort' will come in effect only when 'enableTCPS' field is set
  ## If loadBalancer is enabled, the listenerPort, tcpsListenerPort will be the load balancer ports
  ## If loadBalancer is disabled, the listenerPort, tcpsListenerPort will be the node ports(should be in range 30000-32767)
  ## If enableTCPS is set, and listenerPort is commented/not mentioned in the YAML file, only TCPS endpoint will be exposed
  #listenerPort: 30001
  #tcpsListenerPort: 30002

  ## Service Annotations (Cloud provider specific), for configuring the service (e.g. private LoadBalancer service)
  #serviceAnnotations:
  #  service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-internal: "true"

  ## Deploy only on nodes having required labels. Format label_name: label_value
  ## For instance if the pods need to be restricted to a particular AD
  ## Leave commented if there is no such requirement.
  # nodeSelector:
  #   topology.kubernetes.io/zone: PHX-AD-1

  ## If deploying on OpenShift, change service account name to 'sidb-sa' after you run `$ oc apply -f openshift_rbac.yaml`
  serviceAccountName: default

  ## Count of Database Pods. Only one pod will have the DB mounted and open.
  ## The other replica pods will have instance up and will mount and open the DB if the primary pod dies
  ## For "ReadWriteOnce" AccessMode, all the replicas will schedule on the same node that has the storage attached
  ## For minimal downtime during patching set the count of replicas > 1
  ## Express edition can only have one replica and does not support patching
  replicas: 1
