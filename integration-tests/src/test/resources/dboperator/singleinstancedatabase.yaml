metadata:
  name: sidb-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  
  ## Use only alphanumeric characters for sid up to a maximum of 8 characters
  sid: ORCL1
  
  ## Specify a source database ref to copy/clone from any SIDB in current K8s cluster instead of creating a fresh one
  ## If cloning from an external containerized DB which could be either standalone or in any K8s cluster,
  ## specify connect string as `<host>:<port>/<service_name>` instead of source database ref
  cloneFrom: ""

  ## Reference to a source primary database from which
  ## Format: 1. Intra-cluster: you can give name of the primary database or the database connect string in `<host>:<port>/<service_name>` format
  ##         2. Inter-cluster: Database connect string in `<host>:<port>/<service_name>` format
  primaryDatabaseRef: ""

  ## Enable this flag for creating Physical Standby Database
  createAsStandby: false

  ## DB edition. N/A if cloning from a Source DB in current K8s cluster (if cloneFrom is set to a database ref)
  ## Valid values for edition are enterprise, standard or express
  edition: enterprise
  
  ## Secret containing SIDB password mapped to secretKey. secretKey defaults to oracle_pwd
  ## Should refer to adminPassword of Source DB if cloning from a Source DB (i.e if cloneFrom is set)
  ## This secret will be deleted after creation of the database unless keepSecret is set to true which is the default
  adminPassword:
    secretName: 
    secretKey:
    keepSecret: true

  ## DB character set. N/A if cloning from a Source DB (if cloneFrom is set)
  charset: AL32UTF8

  ## PDB name. N/A if cloning from a Source DB (if cloneFrom is set)
  pdbName: orclpdb1

  ## Enable/Disable Flashback
  flashBack: false

  ## Enable/Disable ArchiveLog. Should be true to allow DB cloning
  archiveLog: false

  ## Enable/Disable ForceLogging
  forceLog: false

  ## Enable TCPS
  enableTCPS: false

  ## TCPS Certificate Renewal Interval: The time after which TCPS certificate will be renewed if TCPS connections are enabled.
  ## tcpsCertRenewInterval can be in hours(h), minutes(m) and seconds(s); e.g. 4380h, 8760h etc.
  ## Maximum value is 8760h (1 year), Minimum value is 24h; Default value is 8760h (1 year)
  ## If this field is commented out/removed from the yaml, it will disable the auto-renewal feature for TCPS certificate
  tcpsCertRenewInterval: 8760h

  ## NA if cloning from a SourceDB (cloneFrom is set)
  ## Specify both sgaSize and pgaSize (in MB) or dont specify both
  ## Specify Non-Zero value to use
  ## You cannot change these initParams for Oracle Database Express (XE) edition
  initParams:
    cpuCount: 0
    processes: 0
    sgaTarget: 0
    pgaAggregateTarget: 0

  ## Database image details
  ## Base DB images are available at container-registry.oracle.com or build from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance
  ## Build patched DB images from https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/extensions/patching
  ## Prebuilt DB support (https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/extensions/prebuiltdb)
  ## Specify prebuiltDB as true if the image includes a prebuilt DB
  ## If cloning specify an image that is of same major version as the source DB at same or different patch levels
  image:
    pullFrom:
    pullSecrets:
    prebuiltDB: false

  ## size is the required minimum size of the persistent volume
  ## storageClass is specified for automatic volume provisioning
  ## accessMode can only accept one of ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany
  ## volumeName is optional. Specify for binding to a specific PV and set storageClass to an empty string to disable automatic volume provisioning
  persistence:
    size: 100Gi
    ## oci-bv applies to OCI block volumes. Use "standard" storageClass for dynamic provisioning in Minikube. Update as appropriate for other cloud service providers
    storageClass: "oci-bv"
    accessMode: "ReadWriteOnce"
    volumeName: ""

  ## Type of service . Applicable on cloud enviroments only
  ## if loadBalService : false, service type = "NodePort" else "LoadBalancer"
  loadBalancer: false
  
  ## 'listenerPort' and 'tcpsListenerPort' fields customizes port cofigurations for normal and tcps database listeners
  ## 'tcpsListenerPort' will come in effect only when 'enableTCPS' field is set
  ## If loadBalancer is enabled, the listenerPort, tcpsListenerPort will be the load balancer ports
  ## If loadBalancer is disabled, the listenerPort, tcpsListenerPort will be the node ports(should be in range 30000-32767)
  ## If enableTCPS is set, and listenerPort is commented/not mentioned in the YAML file, only TCPS endpoint will be exposed
  #listenerPort: 30001
  #tcpsListenerPort: 30002

  ## Service Annotations (Cloud provider specific), for configuring the service (e.g. private LoadBalancer service)
  #serviceAnnotations:
  #  service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-internal: "true"

  ## Deploy only on nodes having required labels. Format label_name: label_value
  ## For instance if the pods need to be restricted to a particular AD
  ## Leave commented if there is no such requirement.
  # nodeSelector:
  #   topology.kubernetes.io/zone: PHX-AD-1

  ## If deploying on OpenShift, change service account name to 'sidb-sa' after you run `$ oc apply -f openshift_rbac.yaml`
  serviceAccountName: default

  ## Count of Database Pods. Only one pod will have the DB mounted and open.
  ## The other replica pods will have instance up and will mount and open the DB if the primary pod dies
  ## For "ReadWriteOnce" AccessMode, all the replicas will schedule on the same node that has the storage attached
  ## For minimal downtime during patching set the count of replicas > 1
  ## Express edition can only have one replica and does not support patching
  replicas: 1
