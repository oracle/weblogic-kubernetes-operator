                  the newly created pod will have the exporter sidecar or not, as

                  field. For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed
                  Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing
                  any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically.
                  This is done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come
                  after "managed-server9". The operator will then start Managed Servers
                  from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific
                  Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the

                  will be started and then additional cluster members will be started,
                  up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in
                  the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members
                  are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then
                  a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas`

                            "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are
                            two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities
                            with the former being the highest priority. Any other
                            name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object
                            with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will
                            be the default or zero, if there is no default. See `kubectl
                            explain pods.spec.priorityClassName`.

                  unless `replicas` is specified for that cluster under the `clusters`
                  field. For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed
                  Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing
                  any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically.
                  This is done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come
                  after "managed-server9". The operator will then start Managed Servers
                  from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific
                  Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the

                  will be started and then additional cluster members will be started,
                  up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in
                  the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members
                  are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then
                  a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas`
