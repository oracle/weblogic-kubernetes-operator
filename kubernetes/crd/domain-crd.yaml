                                    matter which of the three exponent forms is used,
                                    no quantity may represent a number greater than
                                    2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                    3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                    will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will
                                    rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the
                                    future if we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                    a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                    the type of suffix it had, and will use the same
                                    type again when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                    Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This
                                    means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                    or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                    in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                    No fractional digits will be emitted   c. The
                                    exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                    The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                    negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                    as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                    that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                    by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                    point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                    will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                    but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                    (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                    format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                    these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                    handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                    implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5

                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note

                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                        in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3
                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                    values will still parse as long
                                                    as they are well formed, but will
                                                    be re-emitted in their canonical
                                                    form. (So always use canonical

                                in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped
                                or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
                                This may be extended in the future if we require larger
                                or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed
                                from a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                it had, and will use the same type again when it is
                                serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity will be
                                put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix
                                will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                No precision is lost   b. No fractional digits will
                                be emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number
                                is negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized as
                                "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                by a floating point number. That is the whole point
                                of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will still
                                parse as long as they are well formed, but will be
                                re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use
                                canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                to make it difficult to use these numbers without
                                writing some sort of special handling code in the
                                hopes that that will cause implementors to also use
                                a fixed point implementation.'

                                          the three exponent forms is used, no quantity
                                          may represent a number greater than 2^63-1
                                          in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                          3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                          precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                          0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be
                                          extended in the future if we require larger
                                          or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity
                                          is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                          the type of suffix it had, and will use
                                          the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                                          serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical
                                          form". This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                          be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                          increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                          No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                          digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                          (or suffix) is as large as possible. The
                                          sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                          negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                          as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as
                                          "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER
                                          be internally represented by a floating
                                          point number. That is the whole point of
                                          this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                          still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                          but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                          form. (So always use canonical form, or
                                          don''t diff.)  This format is intended to
                                          make it difficult to use these numbers without
                                          writing some sort of special handling code
                                          in the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                          to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                    matter which of the three exponent forms is used,
                                    no quantity may represent a number greater than
                                    2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                    3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                    will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will
                                    rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the
                                    future if we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                    a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                    the type of suffix it had, and will use the same
                                    type again when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                    Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This
                                    means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                    or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                    in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                    No fractional digits will be emitted   c. The
                                    exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                    The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                    negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                    as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                    that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                    by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                    point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                    will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                    but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                    (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                    format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                    these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                    handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                    implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                          precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                          0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be
                                          extended in the future if we require larger
                                          or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity
                                          is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                          the type of suffix it had, and will use
                                          the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                                          serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical
                                          form". This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                          be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                          increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.

                                          digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                          (or suffix) is as large as possible. The
                                          sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                          negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                          as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as
                                          "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER
                                          be internally represented by a floating
                                          point number. That is the whole point of
                                          this exercise.  Non-canonical values will

                                          may represent a number greater than 2^63-1
                                          in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                          3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                          precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                          0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be
                                          extended in the future if we require larger
                                          or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity
                                          is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                          the type of suffix it had, and will use
                                          the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                                          serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical
                                          form". This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                          be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                          increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                          No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                          digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                          (or suffix) is as large as possible. The
                                          sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                          negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                          as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as
                                          "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER
                                          be internally represented by a floating
                                          point number. That is the whole point of
                                          this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                          still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                          but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                          form. (So always use canonical form, or
                                          don''t diff.)  This format is intended to
                                          make it difficult to use these numbers without
                                          writing some sort of special handling code
                                          in the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                          to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                      used, no quantity may represent a number greater
                                      than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more
                                      than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                      precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                      0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                      in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                      quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                      a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                      it had, and will use the same type again when
                                      it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                      will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                      that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                      down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                      in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is
                                      lost   b. No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                      The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                      The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                      negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                      as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                      that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                      by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                      point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                      will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                      but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                      (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                      format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                      these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                      handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                      implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                                0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This
                                                may be extended in the future if we
                                                require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                                a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                                it will remember the type of suffix
                                                it had, and will use the same type
                                                again when it is serialized.  Before
                                                serializing, Quantity will be put
                                                in "canonical form". This means that
                                                Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                                or down (with a corresponding increase
                                                or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.

                                                digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                                The sign will be omitted unless the
                                                number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                                represented by a floating point number.
                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                values will still parse as long as
                                                they are well formed, but will be
                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort

                                                that that will cause implementors

                                          may represent a number greater than 2^63-1
                                          in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                          3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                          precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                          0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be
                                          extended in the future if we require larger
                                          or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity
                                          is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                          the type of suffix it had, and will use
                                          the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                                          serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical
                                          form". This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                          be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                          increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                          No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                          digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                          (or suffix) is as large as possible. The
                                          sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                          negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                          as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as
                                          "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER
                                          be internally represented by a floating
                                          point number. That is the whole point of
                                          this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                          still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                          but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                          form. (So always use canonical form, or
                                          don''t diff.)  This format is intended to
                                          make it difficult to use these numbers without
                                          writing some sort of special handling code
                                          in the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                          to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                                nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                                places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                                will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                                0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This
                                                may be extended in the future if we
                                                require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                                a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                                it will remember the type of suffix
                                                it had, and will use the same type
                                                again when it is serialized.  Before
                                                serializing, Quantity will be put
                                                in "canonical form". This means that
                                                Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                                or down (with a corresponding increase
                                                or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                                No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                                digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                                The sign will be omitted unless the
                                                number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                                represented by a floating point number.
                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                values will still parse as long as
                                                they are well formed, but will be
                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort
                                                of special handling code in the hopes
                                                that that will cause implementors
                                                to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                          is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a

                                          ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you
                                          need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical

                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort

                                      used, no quantity may represent a number greater
                                      than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more
                                      than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                      precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                      0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                      in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                      quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                      a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                      it had, and will use the same type again when
                                      it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                      will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                      that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                      down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                      in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is
                                      lost   b. No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                      The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                      The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                      negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                      as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                      that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                      by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                      point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                      will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                      but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                      (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                      format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                      these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                      handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                      implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                                a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                                it will remember the type of suffix
                                                it had, and will use the same type
                                                again when it is serialized.  Before
                                                serializing, Quantity will be put
                                                in "canonical form". This means that
                                                Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                                or down (with a corresponding increase
                                                or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.

                                                digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                                The sign will be omitted unless the
                                                number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                                represented by a floating point number.
                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                values will still parse as long as
                                                they are well formed, but will be
                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort

                                                that that will cause implementors

                                          in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                          3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                          precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                          0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be
                                          extended in the future if we require larger
                                          or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity
                                          is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                          the type of suffix it had, and will use
                                          the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                                          serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical
                                          form". This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                          be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                          increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                          No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                          digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                          (or suffix) is as large as possible. The
                                          sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                          negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                          as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as
                                          "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER
                                          be internally represented by a floating
                                          point number. That is the whole point of
                                          this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                          still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                          but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                          form. (So always use canonical form, or
                                          don''t diff.)  This format is intended to
                                          make it difficult to use these numbers without
                                          writing some sort of special handling code
                                          in the hopes that that will cause implementors

                                                a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                                nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                                places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                                will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                                0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This
                                                may be extended in the future if we
                                                require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                                a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                                it will remember the type of suffix
                                                it had, and will use the same type
                                                again when it is serialized.  Before
                                                serializing, Quantity will be put
                                                in "canonical form". This means that
                                                Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                                or down (with a corresponding increase
                                                or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                                No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                                digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                                The sign will be omitted unless the
                                                number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                                represented by a floating point number.
                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                values will still parse as long as
                                                they are well formed, but will be
                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort
                                                of special handling code in the hopes
                                                that that will cause implementors
                                                to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                in "canonical form". This means that
                                                Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                                or down (with a corresponding increase
                                                or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                                No precision is lost   b. No fractional
                                                digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                                The sign will be omitted unless the
                                                number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                                represented by a floating point number.
                                                That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                values will still parse as long as
                                                they are well formed, but will be
                                                re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                                (So always use canonical form, or
                                                don''t diff.)  This format is intended
                                                to make it difficult to use these
                                                numbers without writing some sort
                                                of special handling code in the hopes
                                                that that will cause implementors
                                                to also use a fixed point implementation.'
