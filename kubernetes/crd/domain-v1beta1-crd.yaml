                                                      format is intended to make it

                                  in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64()
                                  accessors.  The serialization format is:  <quantity>        ::=
                                  <signedNumber><suffix>   (Note that <suffix> may
                                  be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.) <digit>           ::=
                                  0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> |
                                  <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> |
                                  <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::=
                                  "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number>
                                  <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent>
                                  | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi
                                  | Ti | Pi | Ei   (International System of units;
                                  See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
                                  <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P
                                  | E   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn''t
                                  choose the capitalization.) <decimalExponent> ::=
                                  "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>  No matter
                                  which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity
                                  may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                  nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers
                                  larger or more precise will be capped or rounded
                                  up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                  be extended in the future if we require larger or
                                  smaller quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                  a string, it will remember the type of suffix it
                                  had, and will use the same type again when it is
                                  serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity will be
                                  put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix
                                  will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                  increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                  No precision is lost   b. No fractional digits will
                                  be emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                  as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the
                                  number is negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                  as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                  that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                  by a floating point number. That is the whole point
                                  of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will still
                                  parse as long as they are well formed, but will
                                  be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always
                                  use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This format
                                  is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers
                                  without writing some sort of special handling code
                                  in the hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                  also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                            quantity may represent a number greater
                                            than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have
                                            more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger
                                            or more precise will be capped or rounded
                                            up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
                                            This may be extended in the future if
                                            we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                            a Quantity is parsed from a string, it
                                            will remember the type of suffix it had,
                                            and will use the same type again when
                                            it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                            Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                            This means that Exponent/suffix will be
                                            adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                            increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                            that:   a. No precision is lost   b. No
                                            fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                            The exponent (or suffix) is as large as
                                            possible. The sign will be omitted unless
                                            the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                            will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                            will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that
                                            the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                            represented by a floating point number.
                                            That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                            values will still parse as long as they
                                            are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                            in their canonical form. (So always use
                                            canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                            format is intended to make it difficult
                                            to use these numbers without writing some
                                            sort of special handling code in the hopes
                                            that that will cause implementors to also
                                            use a fixed point implementation.'

                                      used, no quantity may represent a number greater
                                      than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more
                                      than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more
                                      precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                      0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                      in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                      quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                      a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                      it had, and will use the same type again when
                                      it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                      will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                      that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                      down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                      in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is
                                      lost   b. No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                      The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                      The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                      negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                      as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                      that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                      by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                      point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                      will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                      but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                      (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                      format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                      these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                      handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                      implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                            quantity may represent a number greater
                                            than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have
                                            more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger
                                            or more precise will be capped or rounded
                                            up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
                                            This may be extended in the future if
                                            we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                            a Quantity is parsed from a string, it
                                            will remember the type of suffix it had,
                                            and will use the same type again when
                                            it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                            Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                            This means that Exponent/suffix will be
                                            adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                            increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                            that:   a. No precision is lost   b. No
                                            fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                            The exponent (or suffix) is as large as
                                            possible. The sign will be omitted unless
                                            the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                            will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                            will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that
                                            the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                            represented by a floating point number.
                                            That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                            values will still parse as long as they
                                            are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                            in their canonical form. (So always use
                                            canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                            format is intended to make it difficult
                                            to use these numbers without writing some
                                            sort of special handling code in the hopes
                                            that that will cause implementors to also
                                            use a fixed point implementation.'

                                            quantity may represent a number greater
                                            than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have
                                            more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger
                                            or more precise will be capped or rounded
                                            up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
                                            This may be extended in the future if
                                            we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                            a Quantity is parsed from a string, it
                                            will remember the type of suffix it had,
                                            and will use the same type again when
                                            it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                            Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                            This means that Exponent/suffix will be
                                            adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                            increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                            that:   a. No precision is lost   b. No
                                            fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                            The exponent (or suffix) is as large as
                                            possible. The sign will be omitted unless
                                            the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                            will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                            will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that
                                            the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                            represented by a floating point number.
                                            That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                            values will still parse as long as they
                                            are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                            in their canonical form. (So always use
                                            canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                            format is intended to make it difficult
                                            to use these numbers without writing some
                                            sort of special handling code in the hopes
                                            that that will cause implementors to also
                                            use a fixed point implementation.'

                                    matter which of the three exponent forms is used,
                                    no quantity may represent a number greater than
                                    2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                    3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                    will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will
                                    rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the
                                    future if we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                    a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                    the type of suffix it had, and will use the same
                                    type again when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                    Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This
                                    means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                    or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                    in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                    No fractional digits will be emitted   c. The
                                    exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                    The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                    negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                    as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                    that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                    by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                    point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                    will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                    but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                    (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                    format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                    these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                    handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                    implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                        three exponent forms is used, no quantity
                                        may represent a number greater than 2^63-1
                                        in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3
                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                  when it is serialized.  Before serializing,

                                                  as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                                  unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5

                              forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater
                              than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                              3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will
                              be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up
                              to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require
                              larger or smaller quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed
                              from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it
                              had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.  Before
                              serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                              This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                              or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in
                              Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c. The exponent
                              (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be
                              omitted unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized
                              as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                              represented by a floating point number. That is the
                              whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                              will still parse as long as they are well formed, but
                              will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always
                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This format is
                              intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without
                              writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes
                              that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed

                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                  may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                  nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers
                                  larger or more precise will be capped or rounded
                                  up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                  be extended in the future if we require larger or
                                  smaller quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                  a string, it will remember the type of suffix it
                                  had, and will use the same type again when it is
                                  serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity will be
                                  put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix
                                  will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                  increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:   a.
                                  No precision is lost   b. No fractional digits will
                                  be emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                  as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the
                                  number is negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                  as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                  that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                  by a floating point number. That is the whole point
                                  of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will still
                                  parse as long as they are well formed, but will

                                        may represent a number greater than 2^63-1
                                        in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3
                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                        in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3
                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                                        a Quantity is parsed from
                                                        a string, it will remember
                                                        the type of suffix it had,
                                                        and will use the same type
                                                        again when it is serialized.  Before
                                                        serializing, Quantity will
                                                        be put in "canonical form".
                                                        This means that Exponent/suffix
                                                        will be adjusted up or down

                                                        or decrease in Mantissa) such

                                                        will be emitted   c. The exponent
                                                        (or suffix) is as large as
                                                        possible. The sign will be
                                                        omitted unless the number
                                                        is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                                        will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                                        that the quantity will NEVER
                                                        be internally represented
                                                        by a floating point number.
                                                        That is the whole point of
                                                        this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                                        values will still parse as
                                                        long as they are well formed,
                                                        but will be re-emitted in
                                                        their canonical form. (So
                                                        always use canonical form,
                                                        or don''t diff.)  This format
                                                        is intended to make it difficult
                                                        to use these numbers without

                                    no quantity may represent a number greater than
                                    2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than
                                    3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                    will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will
                                    rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the
                                    future if we require larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                    a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember
                                    the type of suffix it had, and will use the same
                                    type again when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                    Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This
                                    means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up
                                    or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                    in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                    No fractional digits will be emitted   c. The
                                    exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
                                    The sign will be omitted unless the number is
                                    negative.  Examples:   1.5 will be serialized
                                    as "1500m"   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                    that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented
                                    by a floating point number. That is the whole
                                    point of this exercise.  Non-canonical values
                                    will still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                    but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.
                                    (So always use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                    format is intended to make it difficult to use
                                    these numbers without writing some sort of special
                                    handling code in the hopes that that will cause
                                    implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                        in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3
                                        decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                        will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
                                        will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended
                                        in the future if we require larger or smaller
                                        quantities.  When a Quantity is parsed from
                                        a string, it will remember the type of suffix
                                        it had, and will use the same type again when
                                        it is serialized.  Before serializing, Quantity
                                        will be put in "canonical form". This means
                                        that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or
                                        down (with a corresponding increase or decrease
                                        in Mantissa) such that:   a. No precision
                                        is lost   b. No fractional digits will be
                                        emitted   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as
                                        large as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                        unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                        will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi will
                                        be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note that the quantity
                                        will NEVER be internally represented by a
                                        floating point number. That is the whole point
                                        of this exercise.  Non-canonical values will
                                        still parse as long as they are well formed,
                                        but will be re-emitted in their canonical
                                        form. (So always use canonical form, or don''t
                                        diff.)  This format is intended to make it
                                        difficult to use these numbers without writing
                                        some sort of special handling code in the
                                        hopes that that will cause implementors to
                                        also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted

                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'

                                              is used, no quantity may represent a
                                              number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude,
                                              nor may it have more than 3 decimal
                                              places. Numbers larger or more precise
                                              will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.:
                                              0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may
                                              be extended in the future if we require
                                              larger or smaller quantities.  When
                                              a Quantity is parsed from a string,
                                              it will remember the type of suffix
                                              it had, and will use the same type again
                                              when it is serialized.  Before serializing,
                                              Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
                                              This means that Exponent/suffix will
                                              be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding
                                              increase or decrease in Mantissa) such
                                              that:   a. No precision is lost   b.
                                              No fractional digits will be emitted   c.
                                              The exponent (or suffix) is as large
                                              as possible. The sign will be omitted
                                              unless the number is negative.  Examples:   1.5
                                              will be serialized as "1500m"   1.5Gi
                                              will be serialized as "1536Mi"  Note
                                              that the quantity will NEVER be internally
                                              represented by a floating point number.
                                              That is the whole point of this exercise.  Non-canonical
                                              values will still parse as long as they
                                              are well formed, but will be re-emitted
                                              in their canonical form. (So always
                                              use canonical form, or don''t diff.)  This
                                              format is intended to make it difficult
                                              to use these numbers without writing
                                              some sort of special handling code in
                                              the hopes that that will cause implementors
                                              to also use a fixed point implementation.'
