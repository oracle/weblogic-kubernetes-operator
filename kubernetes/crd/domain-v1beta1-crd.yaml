                        a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the
                        pod priority will be the default or zero, if there is no default.

                For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server
                names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers

                done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come after "managed-server9".
                The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list,
                up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified
                as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that

                cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding
                further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started.
                If cluster members are started because of their entries under `managedServers`,
                then a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas`
