# Options for externally exposing the operator REST https interface
# (i.e. outside of the Kubernetes cluster). Valid values are:
#
# "NONE"
#    The REST interface is not exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster.
#
# "SELF_SIGNED_CERT"
#    The REST interface is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster on the

#
# "CUSTOM_CERT"
#    The REST interface is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster on the
#    port specified by the 'externalRestHttpsPort' property.
#    The customer supplied certificate and private key are used for the REST
#    interface.  They are specified by the 'externalOperatorCert' and
#    'eternalOperatorKey' properties.
