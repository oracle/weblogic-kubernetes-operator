# WebLogic Operator Load Balancer Samples

## Load balancer sample scripts

The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator supports three load balancers: TRAEFIK, VOYAGER, and APACHE. We provide samples that demonstrate how to install and configure each one. The samples are located in following folders:

* [traefik](traefik/README.md)
* [voyager](voyager/README.md)
* [apache-samples](apache-samples/README.md)
* [ingress-per-domain](ingress-per-domain/README.md)
* [apache-webtier](apache-webtier/README.md)

**Note**: The apache-webtier script contains a Helm chart that is used in the Apache samples.
