# OracleFMWInfrastructure Server image that the operator uses to start the domain.
#
# The create domain scripts generate a OracleFMWInfrastructure Server image with a domain home in it.
# By default, the scripts tag the generated OracleFMWInfrastructure server image as 
# `domain-home-in-image`, and use it to set the `image` element in the generated domain YAML file.
#
# If this property is set, the create domain scripts will use the value specified, instead of the
# default value, to tag the generated image and set the `image` in the domain YAML file.
#
# A unique value is required for each domain that is created using the scripts.
#
# If you are running the sample scripts from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster where
# the domain is going to be running, you need to set this property to the image name that is intended
# to be used in a registry local to that Kubernetes cluster. You also need to push the `image` to
# that registry before starting the domain using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command.
# See README.md for more help.

# Base OracleFMWInfrastructure binary image used to build the OracleFMWInfrastructure domain image
# The operator requires OracleFMWInfrastructure Server 12.2.1.3.0 with patch 29135930 applied.

#
# **NOTE**:
# This sample uses General Availability (GA) images. GA images are suitable for demonstration and
# development purposes only where the environments are not available from the public Internet;
# they are not acceptable for production use. In production, you should always use CPU (patched)
# images from OCR or create your images using the WebLogic Image Tool.
# Please refer to the `OCR` and `Manage FMW infrastructure domains` pages in the WebLogic
# Kubernetes Operator documentation for details.
