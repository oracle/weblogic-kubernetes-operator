# Sample Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim

The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC), which can then be used in a domain custom resource as a persistent storage for the WebLogic domain home or log files.

A PV and PVC can be shared by multiple WebLogic domains or dedicated to a particular domain.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be handled prior to running the create script:
* Create a Kubernetes namespace for the persistent volume claim unless the intention is to use the default namespace. Note that a PVC has to be in the same namespace as the domain resource that uses it.
* Make sure that the host directory that will be used as the persistent volume already exists and has the appropriate file permissions set.

## Using the scripts to create a PV and PVC  

Prior to running the `create-pv-pvc.sh` script, make a copy of the `create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml` file, and uncomment and explicitly configure the `weblogicDomainStoragePath` property in the inputs file.

Run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory:

```
  ./create-pv-pvc.sh \
  -i create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml \
  -o /path/to/output-directory
```

The `create-pv-pvc.sh` script will create a subdirectory `pv-pvcs` under the given `/path/to/output-directory` directory. By default, the script generates two YAML files, namely `weblogic-sample-pv.yaml` and `weblogic-sample-pvc.yaml`, in the `/path/to/output-directory` `directory/pv-pvcs`. These two YAML files can be used to create the Kubernetes resources using the `kubectl create -f` command.

```
  kubectl create -f weblogic-sample-pv.yaml
  kubectl create -f weblogic-sample-pvc.yaml

```

As a convenience, the script can optionally create the PV and PVC resources using the `-e` option.

The usage of the create script is as follows:

```
$ sh create-pv-pvc.sh -h
usage: create-pv-pvc.sh -i file -o dir [-e] [-h]
  -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified.
  -o Output directory for the generated yaml files, must be specified.
  -e Also create the Kubernetes objects using the generated yaml files
  -h Help
```

If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the `<weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project>/kubernetes/samples/scripts` directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.

## Configuration parameters

The PV and PVC creation inputs can be customized by editing the `create-pv-pvc-inputs.yaml` file.

| Parameter | Definition | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domainUID` | ID of the domain resource to which the generated PV and PVC will be dedicated. Leave it empty if the PV and PVC are going to be shared by multiple domains. | no default |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace to create the PVC. | `default` |
| `baseName` | Base name of the PV and PVC. The generated PV and PVC will be `<baseName>-pv` and `<baseName>-pvc` respectively. | `weblogic-sample` |
| `weblogicDomainStoragePath` | Physical path of the storage for the PV. | no default |
| `weblogicDomainStorageReclaimPolicy` | Kubernetes PVC policy for the persistent storage. The valid values are: `Retain`, `Delete`, and `Recycle`. | `Retain` |
| `weblogicDomainStorageSize` | Total storage allocated for the PVC. | `10Gi` |
| `weblogicDomainStorageType` | Type of storage. Legal values are `NFS` and `HOST_PATH`. If using `NFS`, `weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer` must be specified. | `HOST_PATH` |
| `weblogicDomainStorageNFSServer`| Name of the IP address of the NFS server. This setting only applies if `weblogicDomainStorateType` is `NFS`.  | no default |

## Shared versus dedicated PVC

By default, the `domainUID` is left empty in the inputs file so that the generated PV and PVC can be shared by multiple domain resources in the same Kubernetes namespaces.

For the use cases where a dedicated PV and PVC is desired for a particular domain, the `domainUID` can be set, which will cause the generated PV and PVC to be associated with the specified `domainUID`. In the per domain PV and PVC case, the names of the generated YAML files and the Kubernetes PV and PVC objects are decorated with the `domainUID`, and the PV and PVC objects are also labeled with the `domainUID`.

## Common problems

This section provides details of common problems that might occur while running the script and how to resolve them.

### Persistent volume provider not configured correctly

Possibly the most common problem experienced during testing was the incorrect configuration of the persistent volume provider.  The persistent volume must be accessible to all Kubernetes nodes, and must be able to be mounted as Read/Write/Many.  If this is not the case, the PV/PVC creation will fail.

The simplest case is where the `HOST_PATH` provider is used.  This can be either with one Kubernetes node, or with the `HOST_PATH` residing in shared storage available at the same location on every node (for example, on an NFS mount).  In this case, the path used for the persistent volume must have its permission bits set to 777.

## Verify the results

The create script will verify that the PV and PVC were created, and will report a failure if there was any error.  However, it may be desirable to manually verify the PV and PVC, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

### Verify the PV and PVC objects

To confirm that the PV and PVC were created, use these commands:

```
kubectl describe pv
kubectl describe pvc -n NAMESPACE
```

Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace that the PVC was created in.  The output of this command will provide details of the PV, as shown in this example:

```
$ kubectl describe pv weblogic-sample-pv
