# WebLogic Server image that the operator uses to start the domain.
#
# The create domain scripts generate a WebLogic Server image with a domain home in it.
# By default, the scripts tag the generated WebLogic Server image as either
# `domain-home-in-image` or `domain-home-in-image-wdt` based on the `domainHomeImageBuildPath`
# property, and use it to set the `image` element in the generated domain YAML file.
#
# If this property is set, the create domain scripts will use the value specified, instead of the
# default value, to tag the generated image and set the `image` in the domain YAML file.
#
# A unique value is required for each domain that is created using the scripts.
#
# If you are running the sample scripts from a machine that is remote to the Kubernetes cluster where
# the domain is going to be running, you need to set this property to the image name that is intended
# to be used in a registry local to that Kubernetes cluster. You also need to push the `image` to
# that registry before starting the domain using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command.
# See README.md for more help.
