# WebLogic Sample Domain Home on a Persistent Volume

The sample scripts demonstrate the creation of a WebLogic domain home on an existing Kubernetes Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). The scripts also generate the domain YAML file, which can then be used to start the Kubernetes artifacts of the corresponding domain. Optionally, the scripts start up the domain, and WebLogic Server pods and services.

## Prerequisites

Please read this guide before proceeding.
* [Domain Resource](../../../../site/domain-resource.md)

The following prerequisites must be handled prior to running the create domain script:
* Make sure the WebLogic Operator is running.
* Create a Kubernetes namespace for the domain unless the intention is to use the default namespace.
* In the same Kubernetes namespace, create the Kubernetes persistent volume where the domain home will be hosted, and the Kubernetes persistent volume claim for the domain. For samples to create a PV and PVC, refer to [Create sample PV and PVC](../../create-weblogic-domain-pv-pvc/README.md).
* Create the Kubernetes secrets `username` and `password` of the admin account in the same Kubernetes namespace as the domain.

## Using the script to create a domain

Make a copy of the `create-domain-inputs.yaml` file, and run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and an output directory:

```
  ./create-domain.sh \
  -i create-domain-inputs.yaml \
  -o /path/to/output-directory
```

The script will perform the following steps:

* Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain if it does not already exist.  The pathname is `/path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>`. Note that the script fails if the directory is not empty when the `create-domain.sh` script is executed.
* Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility WebLogic Server container and run offline WLST scripts, or WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) scripts, to create the domain on the shared storage.
* Run the job and wait for the job to finish.
* Create a Kubernetes domain YAML file, `domain.yaml`, in the directory that is created above. This YAML file can be used to create the Kubernetes resource using the `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` command.
* Create a convenient utility script, `delete-domain-job.yaml`, to clean up the domain home created by the create script.

As a convenience, using the `-e` option, the script can optionally create the domain object, which in turn results in the creation of the corresponding WebLogic Server pods and services as well.

The usage of the create script is as follows:

```
$ sh create-domain.sh -h
usage: create-domain.sh -o dir -i file [-e] [-v] [-h]
  -i Parameter inputs file, must be specified.
  -o Output directory for the generated YAML files, must be specified.
  -e Also create the resources in the generated YAML files, optional.
  -v Validate the existence of persistentVolumeClaim, optional.
  -h Help

```

If you copy the sample scripts to a different location, make sure that you copy everything in the `<weblogic-kubernetes-operator-project>/kubernetes/samples/scripts` directory together into the target directory, maintaining the original directory hierarchy.

The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:

* An Administration Server named `admin-server` listening on port `7001`.
* A dynamic cluster named `cluster-1` of size 2.
* Two Managed Servers, named `managed-server1` and `managed-server2`, listening on port `8001`.
* Log files that are located in `/shared/logs/<domainUID>`.
* No applications deployed.
* No data sources or JMS resources.
* A T3 channel.

The domain creation inputs can be customized by editing `create-domain-inputs.yaml`.

### Configuration parameters
The following parameters can be provided in the inputs file.

| Parameter | Definition | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adminPort` | Port number for the Administration Server inside the Kubernetes cluster. | `7001` |
| `adminNodePort` | Port number of the Administration Server outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `30701` |
| `adminServerName` | Name of the Administration Server. | `admin-server` |
| `clusterName` | Name of the WebLogic cluster instance to generate for the domain. | `cluster-1` |
| `clusterType` | Type of WebLogic Cluster. Legal values are `CONFIGURED` or `DYNAMIC`. | `DYNAMIC` |
| `configuredManagedServerCount` | Number of Managed Server instances to generate for the domain. | `2` |
| `createDomainFilesDir` | Directory to get all the create domain scripts and supporting files, including the script that is specified by the `createDomainScriptName` property. By default, this directory is set to the relative path `wlst`, and the create script will use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the `wlst` directory to create the WebLogic domain. It can also be set to the relative path `wdt`, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be used instead. An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system. | `wlst` |
| `createDomainScriptsMountPath` | Mount path of the directory where the create domain scripts are located inside the pod. | `/u01/weblogic` |
| `createDomainScriptName` | Script that creates the domain. | `create-domain-job.sh` |
| `domainHome` | Home directory of the WebLogic domain. | `/shared/domains/<domainUID>` |
| `domainPVMountPath` | Mount path of the domain persistent volume. | `/shared` |
| `domainUID` | Unique ID that will be used to identify this particular domain. Used as the name of the generated WebLogic domain as well as the name of the Kubernetes domain resource. This ID must be unique across all domains in a Kubernetes cluster. This ID cannot contain any character that is not valid in a Kubernetes service name. | `domain1` |
| `exposeAdminNodePort` | Boolean indicating if the Administration Server is exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `exposeAdminT3Channel` | Boolean indicating if the T3 administrative channel is exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. | `false` |
| `image` | WebLogic Docker image. | `store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3` |
| `imagePullPolicy` | WebLogic Docker image pull policy. Legal values are "IfNotPresent", "Always", or "Never" | `IfNotPresent` |
| `imagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes secret to access the Docker Store to pull the WebLogic Server Docker image. The presence of the secret will be validated when this parameter is specified |  |
| `includeServerOutInPodLog` | Boolean indicating whether to include server .out to the pod's stdout. | `true` |
| `initialManagedServerReplicas` | Number of Managed Servers to initially start for the domain. | `2` |
| `javaOptions` | Java options for starting the Administration and Managed Servers. A Java option can have references to one or more of the following pre-defined variables to obtain WebLogic domain information: `$(DOMAIN_NAME)`, `$(DOMAIN_HOME)`, `$(ADMIN_NAME)`, `$(ADMIN_PORT)`, and `$(SERVER_NAME)`. | `-Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false` |
| `logHome` | The in-pod name of the directory to store the domain, node manager, server logs, and server .out files in. | `/shared/logs/<domainUID>` |
| `managedServerNameBase` | Base string used to generate Managed Server names. | `managed-server` |
| `managedServerPort` | Port number for each Managed Server. | `8001` |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace in which to create the domain. | `default` |
| `productionModeEnabled` | Boolean indicating if production mode is enabled for the domain. | `true` |
| `serverStartPolicy` | Determines which WebLogic Servers will be started up. Legal values are `NEVER`, `ALWAYS`, `IF_NEEDED`, `ADMIN_ONLY`. | `IF_NEEDED` |
| `t3ChannelPort` | Port for the T3 channel of the NetworkAccessPoint. | `30012` |
| `t3PublicAddress` | Public address for the T3 channel. | `kubernetes` |
| `weblogicCredentialsSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Administration Server's username and password. | `domain1-weblogic-credentials` |
| `weblogicImagePullSecretName` | Name of the Kubernetes secret for the Docker Store, used to pull the WebLogic Server image. | `docker-store-secret` |

Note that the names of the Kubernetes resources in the generated YAML files may be formed with the value of some of the properties specified in the `create-inputs.yaml` file. Those properties include the `adminServerName`, `clusterName` and `managedServerNameBase`. If those values contain any characters that are invalid in a Kubernetes service name, those characters are converted to valid values in the generated YAML files. For example, an uppercase letter is converted to a lowercase letter and an underscore `("_")` is converted to a hyphen `("-")`.

The sample demonstrates how to create a WebLogic domain home and associated Kubernetes resources for a domain that only has one cluster. In addition, the sample provides the capability for users to supply their own scripts to create the domain home for other use cases. The generated domain YAML file could also be modified to cover more use cases.

## Verify the results

The create script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error.  However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

Note that the example results below uses the `default` Kubernetes namespace. If you are using a different namespace, you need to replace `NAMESPACE` in the example `kubectl` commands with the actual Kubernetes namespace.

### Verify the domain

To confirm that the domain was created, use this command:

```
kubectl describe domain DOMAINUID -n NAMESPACE
```

Replace `DOMAINUID` with the `domainUID` and `NAMESPACE` with the actual namespace.

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl describe domain domain1
Name:         domain1
Namespace:    default
Labels:       weblogic.domainName=domain1
              weblogic.domainUID=domain1

```

In the `Status` section of the output, the available servers and clusters are listed.  Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers.  The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready before starting Managed Servers.

### Verify pods

The following command can be used to see the pods running the servers:

```
kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
domain1-admin-server                         1/1       Running   0          1m
domain1-managed-server1                      1/1       Running   0          8m
domain1-managed-server2                      1/1       Running   0          8m
```

### Verify services

The following command can be used to see the services for the domain:

```
kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:
```
$ kubectl get services
NAME                                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

```

## Deleting the Generated Domain Home

Sometimes in production, but most likely in testing environments, you would like to remove the domain home that is generated using `create-domain.sh` script. This can be achieved by running the generated delete domain job script in the `/path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>` directory.

```
$ kubectl create -f delete-domain-job.yaml

```
