# `createDomainScriptsMountPath` property.
#
# If you need to provide your own scripts to create the domain home, instead of using the
# built-it scripts, you must use this property to set the name of the script that you want

# use the built-in WLST offline scripts in the `wlst` directory to create the WebLogic domain.
# It can also be set to the relative path `wdt`, and then the built-in WDT scripts will be
# used instead.
#
# An absolute path is also supported to point to an arbitrary directory in the file system.
#
# The built-in scripts can be replaced by the user-provided scripts or model files as long
# as those files are in the specified directory. Files in this directory are put into a
# Kubernetes config map, which in turn is mounted to the `createDomainScriptsMountPath`,
# so that the Kubernetes pod can use the scripts and supporting files to create a domain home.
