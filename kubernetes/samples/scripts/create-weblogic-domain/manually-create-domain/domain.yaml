apiVersion: "weblogic.oracle/v8"
kind: Domain
metadata:
  # Update this with the `domainUID` of your domain:
  name: domain1
  # Update this with the namespace your domain will run in:
  namespace: weblogic
  labels:
    # Update this with the `domainUID` of your domain:
    weblogic.domainUID: domain1

spec:
  # This parameter provides the location of the WebLogic Domain Home (from the container's point of view).
  # Note that this might be in the image itself or in a mounted volume or network storage.
  domainHome: /u01/oracle/user_projects/domains/domain1

  # Domain home source type.  Legal values are Image, PersistentVolume, or FromModel
  domainHomeSourceType: Image

  # Update this with the name of the Docker image that will be used to run your domain:
  image: "my-domain1-image:1.0"

  # imagePullPolicy defaults to "Always" if image version is :latest
  imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"

  # If credentials are needed to pull the image, uncomment this section and identify which
  # Secret contains the credentials for pulling an image:
  #imagePullSecrets:
  #- name:

  # Identify which Secret contains the WebLogic Admin credentials (note that there is an example of
  # how to create that Secret at the end of this file)
  webLogicCredentialsSecret:
    # Update this with the name of the secret containing your WebLogic server boot credentials:
    name: domain1-weblogic-credentials

  # If you want to include the server out file into the pod's stdout, set this to `true`:
  includeServerOutInPodLog: true

  # If you want to use a mounted volume as the log home, i.e. to persist logs outside the container, then
  # uncomment this and set it to `true`:
  # logHomeEnabled: false
  # The in-pod name of the directory to store the domain, node manager, server logs, and server .out
  # files in.
  # If not specified or empty, domain log file, server logs, server out, and node manager log files
  # will be stored in the default logHome location of /shared/logs/<domainUID>/.
  # logHome: /shared/logs/domain1

  # serverStartPolicy legal values are "NEVER", "IF_NEEDED", or "ADMIN_ONLY"
  # This determines which WebLogic Servers the Operator will start up when it discovers this Domain
  # - "NEVER" will not start any server in the domain
  # - "ADMIN_ONLY" will start up only the administration server (no managed servers will be started)
  # - "IF_NEEDED" will start all non-clustered servers, including the administration server and clustered servers up to the replica count
  serverStartPolicy: "IF_NEEDED"

    # If you are storing your domain on a persistent volume (as opposed to inside the Docker image),

  # adminServer is used to configure the desired behavior for starting the administration server.
  adminServer:
    # serverStartState legal values are "RUNNING" or "ADMIN"
    # "RUNNING" means the listed server will be started up to "RUNNING" mode
    # "ADMIN" means the listed server will be start up to "ADMIN" mode
