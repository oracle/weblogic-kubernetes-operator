# This script stages a wdt model to directory 'WORKDIR/models' for future inclusion
# in a model-in-image image:
#
#   - It builds the 'SCRIPTDIR/sample_app' application 'ear' file, and puts the ear into
#     'WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip' along with the application's model mime mappings 
#     file 'WORKDIR/sample_app/wlsdeploy/config/amimemappings.properties'.
#
#   - It copies WDT model files that contain WebLogic configuration from
#     'SCRIPTDIR' into 'WORKDIR/models'. It chooses the source model file
#     based on WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE.
#
# This script also stages a wdt file to 'WORKDIR/wdtconfigmap' for future inclusion
# in a config map that's in turn referenced by a domain resource.
#
#   - It copies 'WORKDIR/model1.20.properties' to 'WORKDIR/wdtconfigmap'.
#
# Optionally set these environment variables:
#
#    WORKDIR
#      Working directory for the sample with at least 10g of space.
#      Defaults to '/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir'.
#
#    WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE 
#      'WLS' (default), 'JRF', or 'RestrictedJRF'.
#
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTE:
#
#   If you want to specify your own model files for an image and your own
#   wdt config map files, then you don't need to run this script. Instead:
#
#   - Set environment variables that indicate the location 
#     of your model files prior to building your image
#     as per the instructions in './build_image_model.sh'.
#
#   - Set the WDTCONFIGMAPDIR to indicate the location of your
#     wdt config map files, prior to creating your wdt config
#     map (see ./run_domain.sh).
