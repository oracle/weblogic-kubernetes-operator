# This script starts a WebLogic managed server in a domain. 
# Internal code notes :-
# - If server start policy is ALWAYS or policy is IF_NEEDED and the server is selected 
#   to start based on the replica count, it means that server is already started or is
#   in the process of starting. In this case, script exits without making any changes.
#
# - If start policy of servers parent cluster or domain is 'NEVER', script
#   fails as server can't be started.
#
# - If server is part of a cluster and keep_replica_constant option is false (the default)
#   and the effective start policy of the server is IF_NEEDED and increasing replica count
#   will naturally start the server, the script increases the replica count. 
#
# - If server is part of a cluster and keep_replica_constant option is false (the default) 
#   and unsetting policy and increasing the replica count will start this server, script 
#   unsets the policy and increases replica count. For e.g. if replica count is 1 and 
#   start policy of server2 is NEVER, unsetting policy and increasing replica count will 
#   start server2.
#
# - If option to keep replica count constant ('-k') is selected and unsetting start policy
#   will naturally start the server, script will unset the policy. For e.g. if replica count
#   is 2 and start policy  of server2 is NEVER, unsetting policy will start server2.
#
# - If above conditions are not true, it implies that either start policy is NEVER or policy
#   is IF_NEEDED but server is not next in the order to start. In this case, script sets start 
#   policy to ALWAYS. For e.g. replica count is 3 and server10 needs to start. The script also 
#   increments the replica count by default. If option to keep replica count constant ('-k') 
#   is selected, it only sets the start policy to ALWAYS.

  This script starts a WebLogic managed server in a domain either by increasing
  the value of 'spec.clusters[<cluster-name>].replicas' by '1' or by updating the
  'spec.managedServers[<server-name>].serverStartPolicy' attribute of the domain
  resource or both as necessary. The 'spec.clusters[<cluster-name>].replicas' value can
  be kept constant by using '-k' option. Please see README.md for more details.

  Usage:

    $(basename $0) -s myserver [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] [-k] [-m kubecli] [-v]

    -s <server_name>           : Server name parameter is required.

    -d <domain_uid>            : Domain unique-id. Default is 'sample-domain1'.

    -n <namespace>             : Domain namespace. Default is 'sample-domain1-ns'.

    -k <keep_replica_constant> : Keep replica count constant. Default behavior is to increment replica count.

    -m <kubernetes_cli>        : Kubernetes command line interface. Default is 'kubectl' if KUBERNETES_CLI env
                                 variable is not set. Otherwise default is the value of KUBERNETES_CLI env variable.

    -v <verbose_mode>          : Enables verbose mode. Default is 'false'.

    -h                         : This help.
