# When a user installs the WebLogic operator Helm chart, the user can set
# elkIntegrationEnabled to true in their values.yaml to tell the operator to send the
# contents of the operator's log to Elasticsearch.
#
# Typically, a user would have already configured Elasticsearch and Kibana in the
# Kubernetes cluster, and also would specify elasticSearchHost and elasticSearchPort
# in their values.yaml file to point to where Elasticsearch is already running.
#
# This sample configures the Elasticsearch and Kibana deployments and services.
# It's useful for trying out the operator in a Kubernetes cluster that doesn't already
# have them configured.
#
# It runs Elasticstack on the same host and port that the operator's Helm chart defaults
# to, therefore, the customer only needs to set elkIntegrationEnabled to true in their
# values.yaml file.
#
# To configure them, use:
#   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/samples/scripts/elasticsearch_and_kibana.yaml
#
# To remove them, use:
#   kubectl delete -f kubernetes/samples/scripts/elasticsearch_and_kibana.yaml
