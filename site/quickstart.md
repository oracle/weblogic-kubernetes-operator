# Quick Start Guide

Use this Quick Start Guide to create a WebLogic deployment in a Kubernetes cluster.
(Maybe add what users would do with this set up.)  

(Add link to page that describes a very specific deployment following our [samples flow](http://aseng-wiki.us.oracle.com/asengwiki/display/ASDevWLS/2.0+Samples+Flow) with a Traefik load balancer and just one domain. RM, I'm not sure that this is needed in the Quick Start Guide. **This is a tutorial. What we need are the actual commands for each step listed.**)

## 1.	Get the images and put them into your local registry.
Get all the necessary images: Operator, Traefik. (Need a complete list of the required images and pointers to their locations, including the commands for retrieving the images and where users should locate them on their systems.)

## 2. Create a Traefik (Ingress-based) load balancer.
Use Helm to install a [Traefik](samples/charts/traefik/README.md) load balancer. (We can't just use a pointer to a script, we need to copy into this guide, the commands for each step.)

## 3. Configure Kibana and Elasticsearch.
Invoke the script to create these. (Again, list the commands here using an example.)

## 4. Install the operator.
* Create a namespace and service account for the operator (point to sample script that does this.)
* Invoke the script to generate the credentials for the operator and add it to the the operator YAML file (all the values can be left as default).
* Create the operator using `helm install`, and passing in the namespace, service account, and location of Elasticsearch (Point to Helm.)

## 5. Prepare your environment for a domain.
* Create a domain namespace
* Create the Kubernetes secrets for the Administration Server boot credentials
* Create a PV & PVC domain; use script
* Configure the operator to manage the domains in the domain namespace using `helm upgrade`
* Configure the Traefik load balancer to manage the domains in the domain namespace.
  * Use `helm upgrade` to configure the load balancer to monitor the Ingresses in the domain namespace
* Create the domain home
* Create the Docker image for the domain home in the image or use the WebLogic binary image.
  * Run WLST to create the domain in PV (remember to apply patch).

## 6. Create a domain.
* Edit the domain YAML file (can the defaults be used?)
* Create the domain home for the domain
  * For a domain home on PV â€“ as in sample
  * For a domain home in image, use the sample in the Docker GitHub project
* Optionally, create a configuration overrides template and any additional Kubernetes secrets it needs (for example, to override the domain home configuration of a database URL, username, and password).
* Create a domain resource in the domain namespace
  * Specify the following information: domain UID, service account, secret name, the domain home details, and optionally, the configuration overrides template name.
* Configure the operator to know about the domain
* Configure the Traefik load balancer to manage the domain as follows:
  * Create an Ingress for the domain in the domain namespace (it contains the routing rules for the domain)

(At this point, do they have a WebLogic Kubernetes deployment in a Kubernetes cluster? If so, we have to give them something to look at, to verify their results.)

(Removing the domain, operator, and such, isn't really needed in a quick start guide. We can point them to the user's instructions for how to remove the domain, operator, and all the other related resources.)

## 7. Remove a domain.
* Remove the domain's Kubernetes resources (domain, secrets, ingress, ...)
  * If they are all tagged with a `weblogicUID` label, then the sample delete domain script will remove them all  
  * The operator will notice that the domain's domain resource has been removed and will then kill the pods
* Configure the Traefik load balancer to stop managing the domain
  * The delete script will have deleted the Ingress which will inform the load balancer to stop managing the domain
* Remove the domain home if it's on a PV.

## 8. Remove the domain namespace.
* Configure the Traefik load balancer to stop managing the domain namespace. Use `helm upgrade` to remove the domain namespace from the list of namespaces.
* Configure the operator to stop managing the domain. Use `helm upgrade` to remove the domain namespace from the list of domain namespaces
* Remove the PV & PVC for the domain namespace
* Remove the domain namespace

## 9. Remove the operator.
* `helm delete --purge`
* Remove the operator namespace

## 10. Remove other resources.
* Optionally, remove Kibana and Elasticsearch
* Remove the Traefik load balancer, using `helm delete --purge`
* Remove the Traefik namespace
