# Creating a WebLogic domain

The WebLogic domain must be installed into the folder that will be mounted as `/shared/domain`. The recommended approach is to use the provided `create-weblogic-domain.sh` script; however, instructions are also provided for manually installing and configuring a WebLogic domain (see [Manually creating a domain](manually-creating-domain.md)).

Note that there is a short video demonstration of the domain creation process available [here](https://youtu.be/Ey7o8ldKv9Y).

## Important considerations and restrictions for WebLogic domains in Kubernetes

When running a WebLogic domain in Kubernetes, there are some additional considerations that must be taken into account to ensure correct functioning:

*	Multicast is not currently well supported in Kubernetes.  Some networking providers have some support for multicast, but it is generally considered of “beta” quality.  Oracle recommends configuring WebLogic clusters to use unicast.
*	The `ListenAddress` for all servers must be set to the correct DNS name; it should not be set to `0.0.0.0` or left blank.  This is required for cluster discovery of servers to work correctly.
*	If there is a desire to expose a T3 channel outside of the Kubernetes cluster -- for example, to allow WLST or RMI connections from clients outside Kubernetes -- then the recommended approach is to define a dedicated channel (per server) and to expose that channel using a `NodePort` service.  It is required that the channel’s internal and external ports be set to the same value as the chosen `NodePort`; for example, they could all be `32000`.  If all three are not the same, WebLogic Server will reject T3 connection requests.

## Creating a domain namespace

Oracle recommends creating namespaces to host WebLogic domains. It is not required to maintain a one-to-one relationship between WebLogic domains and Kubernetes namespaces, but this may be done if desired. More than one WebLogic domain may be run in a single namespace, if desired.

Any namespaces that were listed in the `targetNamespaces` parameter in the operator parameters file when deploying the operator would have been created by the script.  

To create an additional namespace, issue the following command:

```
kubectl create namespace NAMESPACE
```

In this command, replace `NAMESPACE` with the desired namespace.

**Note:** Kubernetes does not allow uppercase characters in the `NAMESPACE`.  Only lowercase characters, numbers, and the hyphen character are allowed.

## Setting up secrets to access the Docker Store

In order to obtain the WebLogic Server Docker image from the Docker Store, which requires authentication, a Kubernetes secret containing the registry credentials must be created. To create a secret with Docker Store credentials, issue the following command:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry SECRET_NAME
  -n NAMESPACE
  --docker-server=index.docker.io/v1/
  --docker-username=YOUR_USERNAME
  --docker-password=YOUR_PASSWORD
  --docker-email=YOUR_EMAIL
```

In this command, replace the uppercase items with the appropriate values. The `SECRET_NAME` will be needed in later parameter files.  The `NAMESPACE` must match the namespace where the first domain will be deployed, otherwise Kubernetes will not be able to find it.  It is generally easier to manually pull the image in advance, as described in the next section.

## Go to the Docker Store and accept the license agreement for the WebLogic Server image

If you have never used the WebLogic Server image before, you will need to go to the [Docker Store web interface](https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-weblogic-server-12c) and accept the license agreement before Docker Store will allow you to pull this image.  This is a one-time requirement, you do not have to repeat it for each machine you want to use the image on.

## Pull the WebLogic Server image

You can let Kubernetes pull the Docker image for you the first time you try to create a pod that uses the image, but we have found that you can generally avoid various common issues, like putting the secret in the wrong namespace or getting the credentials wrong, by just manually pulling the image by running these commands *on the Kubernetes nodes*:

```
docker login
docker pull store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3
```
## Setting up secrets for the Administration Server credentials

The username and password credentials for access to the Administration Server must be stored in a Kubernetes secret in the same namespace that the domain will run in.  The script does not create the secret in order to avoid storing the credentials in a file.  Oracle recommends that this command be executed in a secure shell and appropriate measures be taken to protect the security of the credentials.

Issue the following command to create the secret:

```
kubectl -n NAMESPACE create secret generic SECRET_NAME
  --from-literal=username=ADMIN-USERNAME
  --from-literal=password=ADMIN-PASSWORD
```

In this command, replace the uppercase items with the correct values for the domain.

The `SECRET_NAME` value specified here must be in the format `DOMAINUID-weblogic-credentials` where `DOMAINUID` is replaced with the `domainUID` for the domain.

## Important considerations for persistent volumes

WebLogic domains that are managed by the operator are required to store their configuration and state on a persistent volume.  This volume is mounted read/write on all containers that are running a server in the domain.  There are many different persistent volume providers, but they do not all support multiple read/write mounts.  It is required that the chosen provider supports multiple read/write mounts. Details of available providers are available at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes).  Careful attention should be given to the information in the table in the section titled, “Access Modes”.

In a single-node Kubernetes cluster, such as may be used for testing or proof of concept activities, `HOST_PATH` provides the simplest configuration.  In a multinode Kubernetes cluster, a `HOST_PATH` that is located on shared storage mounted by all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster is the simplest configuration.  If nodes do not have shared storage, then NFS is probably the most widely available option.  There are other options listed in the referenced table.

## Creating a persistent volume for the domain

The persistent volume for the domain must be created using the appropriate tools before running the script to create the domain.  In the simplest case, namely the `HOST_PATH` provider, this means creating a directory on the Kubernetes master and ensuring that it has the correct permissions:

```
mkdir –m 777 –p /path/to/domain1PersistentVolume
```

For other providers, consult the provider documentation for instructions on how to create a persistent volume.

## Customizing the domain parameters file

The domain is created with the provided installation script (`create-weblogic-domain.sh`).  The input to this script is the file `create-weblogic-domain-inputs.yaml`, which must be copied and updated to reflect the target environment.  

The following parameters must be provided in the input file.

### Configuration parameters for the create domain job

## Limitations of the create domain script

This release has some limitations in the create domain script that users should be aware of.

*	The script creates the specified number of Managed Servers and places them all in one cluster.
*	The script always creates one cluster.

Oracle intends to remove these limitations in a future release.

## Using the script to create a domain

At this point, you've created a customized copy of the inputs file.

Next, choose and create a directory in which generated operator related files will be stored, for example, `/path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory`.

Finally, run the create script, pointing it at your inputs file and output directory:

```
  ./create-weblogic-domain.sh \
  –i create-domain-job-inputs.yaml \
  -o /path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory
```

## What the script does

The script will perform the following steps:

*	Create a directory for the generated Kubernetes YAML files for this domain.  The pathname is `/path/to/weblogic-operator-output-directory/weblogic-domains/<domainUID>`.
*	Create Kubernetes YAML files based on the provided inputs.
*	Create a persistent volume for the shared state.
*	Create a persistent volume claim for that volume.
*	Create a Kubernetes job that will start up a utility WebLogic Server container and run WLST to create the domain on the shared storage.
*	Wait for the job to finish and then create a domain custom resource for the new domain.

The default domain created by the script has the following characteristics:

*	An Administration Server named `admin-server` listening on port `7001`.
*	A single cluster named `cluster-1` containing the specified number of Managed Servers.
*	A Managed Server named `managed-server1` listening on port `8001` (and so on up to the requested number of Managed Servers).
*	Log files that are located in `/shared/logs`.
*	No applications deployed.
*	No data sources.
*	No JMS resources.
*	A T3 channel.

## Common problems

This section provides details of common problems that occur during domain creation and how to resolve them.

### Persistent volume provider not configured correctly

Possibly the most common problem experienced during testing was incorrect configuration of the persistent volume provider.  The persistent volume must be accessible to all Kubernetes nodes, and must be able to be mounted as Read/Write/Many.  If this is not the case, the domain creation will fail.

The simplest case is where the `HOST_PATH` provider is used.  This can be either with one Kubernetes node, or with the `HOST_PATH` residing in shared storage available at the same location on every node (for example, on an NFS mount).  In this case, the path used for the persistent volume must have its permission bits set to 777.

## YAML files created by the script

The script will create a Kubernetes YAML file that is then used to create a Kubernetes job that will perform the actual work to create the domain.  The job will start a pod with the standard WebLogic Server Docker image and will execute some BASH and WLST scripts to create the domain.  

Here is the first part of that YAML file:

```

The lines omitted at the end contain the actual scripts that are executed in this container.  These should generally not be modified, except by developers.  

## Verifying the domain creation

The script will verify that the domain was created, and will report failure if there was any error.  However, it may be desirable to manually verify the domain, even if just to gain familiarity with the various Kubernetes objects that were created by the script.

### Verify the domain custom resource

To confirm that the domain custom resource was created, use this command:

```
kubectl describe domain DOMAINUID -n NAMESPACE
```

Replace `DOMAINUID` with the `domainUID`, and replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace that the domain was created in.  The output of this command will provide details of the domain, as shown in this example:

```
$ kubectl describe domain domain1 -n domain1
Name:         domain1
Namespace:    domain1
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={"apiVersion":"weblogic.oracle/v1","kind":"Domain","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"domain1","namespace":"domain1"},"spec":{"adminSecret":{"name":"...

```

In the `Status` section of the output, the available servers and clusters are listed.  Note that if this command is issued very soon after the script finishes, there may be no servers available yet, or perhaps only the Administration Server but no Managed Servers.  The operator will start up the Administration Server first and wait for it to become ready before starting Managed Servers.

### Verify pods

The following command can be used to see the pods running the servers:

```
kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n domain1
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
domain1-admin-server      1/1       Running   0          22h
domain1-managed-server1   1/1       Running   0          22h
domain1-managed-server2   1/1       Running   0          22h
```

### Verify services

The following command can be used to see the services for the domain:

```
kubectl get services -n NAMESPACE
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl get services -n domain1
NAME                                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

```

### Verify Ingresses

The following command can be used to see the Ingresses for the domain:

```
kubectl describe ing -n domain1
```

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ kubectl describe ing -n domain1
Name:             domain1-cluster-1

        /   domain1-managed-server2:8001 (<none>)
Annotations:

```


## Configuring the domain readiness

Kubernetes has a concept of “readiness” that is used to determine when external requests should be routed to a particular pod.  The domain creation job provided with the operator configures the readiness probe to use the WebLogic Server ReadyApp, which provides a mechanism to check when the server is actually ready to process work, as opposed to simply being in the `RUNNING` state.  Often applications have some work to do after the server is `RUNNING` but before they are ready to process new requests.

ReadyApp provides an API that allows an application to register itself, so that its state will be taken into consideration when determining if the server is “ready”, and an API that allows the application to inform ReadyApp when it considers itself to be ready.
