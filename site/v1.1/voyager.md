# Load balancing with Voyager/HAProxy

This document explains how to set up Voyager to use the HAProxy as a load balancer for WebLogic domains running in Kubernetes.

Voyager is an HAProxy-backed Ingress controller for Kubernetes. For more information about the Voyager Ingress controller, see https://appscode.com/products/voyager/6.0.0/concepts/.

## Set up the Voyager/HAProxy automatically

To set up the Voyager/HAProxy automatically, run the `create-weblogic-domain.sh` script to create a WebLogic domain in Kubernetes. However, first you need to change the domain inputs YAML file. There are three load balancer related properties:

```
...
# Load balancer to deploy.  Supported values are: APACHE, TRAEFIK, VOYAGER, NONE
loadBalancer: VOYAGER
...
# Load balancer web port
loadBalancerWebPort: 30305

# Load balancer dashboard port
loadBalancerDashboardPort: 30315
```

* The `loadBalancer` property needs to be changed to `VOYAGER`.
* The `loadBalancerWebPort` property is used to specify the `NodePort` number to access the HAProxy load balancer itself.
* The `loadBalancerDashboardPort` property is used to specify the `NodePort` number to access the HAPRoxy stats web page.

Then, after running the `create-weblogic-domain.sh script`, the WebLogic domain is created and the Voyager/HAProxy is also installed and configured properly.
You can access the HAProxy stats web page using `http://<hostIP>:30315/` and will see a web page like the following:

After you deploy an application to the WebLogic cluster, you can send requests to the application using `http://<hostIP>:30305/<ctx>/`. The requests are sent to the HAProxy load balancer and HAProxy will distribute the requests to the Managed Servers of the WebLogic cluster.

### What happens underground?
#### 1. Install the Voyager operator
If it hasn't been done before, the Voyager operator is installed in the `voyager` namespace.

You should have a `voyager-operator-***` pod running in the `voyager` namespace.
```
$ kubectl get pod -n voyager
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
voyager-operator-86bcd6f656-jj2t6   1/1       Running   1          8d
```
New CRD groups are registered by the Voyager operator.
```
$ kubectl get crd -l app=voyager
NAME                                AGE
certificates.voyager.appscode.com   8d
ingresses.voyager.appscode.com      8d
```
Now the Voyager operator watches the Ingress resources in any namespace.

#### 2. Create a Voyager Ingress resource
An Ingress resource is generated based on the WebLogic domain configuration and deployed to Kubernetes. Here is an example of what the Voyager Ingress resource might look like for a WebLogic cluster named `cluster-1`, in a domain named `base_domain` with domainUID `domain1`.

```yaml
apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: domain1-voyager
  namespace: default
  labels:
    weblogic.domainUID: domain1
    weblogic.domainName: base_domain
  annotations:
    ingress.appscode.com/type: 'NodePort'
    ingress.appscode.com/stats: 'true'
    ingress.appscode.com/affinity: 'cookie'
spec:
  rules:
  - host: '*'
    http:
      nodePort: '30305'
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: domain1-cluster-cluster-1
          servicePort: '8001'
```

The Kubernetes service named `domain1-cluster-cluster-1`, referred to by the Ingress resource, is also created by the `create-weblogic-domain.sh` script, which dynamically includes all the Managed Servers in the cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoints domain1-cluster-cluster-1
NAME                        ENDPOINTS                                               AGE
domain1-cluster-cluster-1   10.244.0.170:8001,10.244.0.171:8001,10.244.0.172:8001   2d
```
When the Ingress resource is deployed, the following Kubernetes resources are created by the Voyager operator:
```bash
$ kubectl get deploy,pod,svc | awk '/voyager/ || /NAME/'
NAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/voyager-domain1-voyager   1         1         1            1           1d

NAME                                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/voyager-domain1-voyager-577bcfb4b-kbnhp   1/1       Running   0          1d

NAME                                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
svc/voyager-domain1-voyager                     NodePort    10.109.137.41    <none>        80:30305/TCP      1d
svc/voyager-domain1-voyager-stats               ClusterIP   10.105.160.124   <none>        56789/TCP         1d
```
#### 3. Create a NodePort service                                         
A NodePort service is created to expose the HAProxy stats. The following is an example YAML file for the service.  

```yaml                                                                
apiVersion: v1                                                         
kind: Service                                                          
metadata:                                                              
  name: domain1-voyager-stats                                          
  namespace: default                                                   
  labels:                                                              
    app: domain1-voyager-stats                                         
    weblogic.domainUID: domain1                                        
    weblogic.domainName: base_domain                                   
spec:                                                                  
  type: NodePort                                                       
  ports:                                                               
    - name: client                                                     
      protocol: TCP                                                    
      port: 56789                                                      
      targetPort: 56789                                                
      nodePort: 30315                                                  
  selector:                                                            
    origin: voyager                                                    
    origin-name: domain1-voyager                                       
```                                                                    

## Set up Voyager manually to load balance a WebLogic domain running in Kubernetes
You may want to manually set up Voyager to load balance a WebLogic domain running in Kubernetes, in cases when some of the default settings of the automatic steps don't meet your requirements, or your WebLogic domain is not created by the WebLogic Operator.
To do the setup, refer to the Voyager documents at https://appscode.com/products/voyager/6.0.0/setup/.
### 1. Install the Voyager operator
Refer to Voyager install guide at https://appscode.com/products/voyager/6.0.0/setup/install/.
### 2. Create a Voyager Ingress resource
Refer to the details at https://appscode.com/products/voyager/6.0.0/concepts/overview/. You can choose different types for your Ingress: LoadBalancer, NodePort, HostPort, and Internal.
