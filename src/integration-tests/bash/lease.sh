  Summary:

    Use this helper script to obtain an exclusive 10 minute lease
    on a kubernetes cluster, renew this lease, release this lease,
    force the delete of the lease, or view the current lease.
    It exits with a non-zero value on a failure.

  Usage:

    Obtain       : lease.sh -o id [-t timeout]
    Renew        : lease.sh -r id
    Delete       : lease.sh -d id
    Force Delete : lease.sh -f
    Show         : lease.sh -s
    Help         : lease.sh -h

    The user is expected to call this script multiple times throughout
    the ownership of a lease:

    1) First, call 'lease.sh -o id' to try obtain a lease.  If
       this fails, fail your script, since failure may mean some other
       owner has ownership.  This call will block up to 30 minutes
       while trying to get the lease (tunable via -t), and will grab
       the lease if no other process owns it or no other process has touched
       it for a period of 10 minutes.  'id' should be some unique
       string suitable for use as a filename - a uuid is preferred but a
       pid is usually sufficient.

    2) While running, call 'lease.sh -r id' every few minutes
       to renew the lease and retain ownership.   Fail if this fails,
       since that means you may have lost the lease.  Be careful to call
       this within 10 minutes of last obtaining or renewing the lease,
       otherwise the lease expires and another process is free to obtain
       ownership.  Use the same value of 'id' as was specified in step (1).

    3) Finally, call 'lease.sh -d id' to delete and give up your
       lease.  This will fail if you are not the current owner.  Use the same
       value of 'id' as was specified in step (1).  If you forget to
       call it, no one else will be able to get the lease for up to 10
       minutes.

    To show who currently owns a lease, call 'lease.sh -s' or call
    'kubectl get cm acceptance-test-lease -o yaml -n default'.

    To force delete a lease no matter who owns the lease, call
    'lease.sh -f' or 'kubectl delete cm acceptance-test-lease -n default'.
    This should only be done if you're sure there's
    no current processe that owns the lease.

  Warnings:

    This is a 'best effort' script -- it still has potential race
    conditions.  They should be pretty rare, but don't bet the farm on
    them not happening!

    This script requires cooperation among all users of the k8s cluster that
    need exclusive access - they all must use the script.  The script
    doesn't directly grant exclusive access, it just can be used to make sure
    that no other callers of the same script have the lease.


  Internals:

    This script maintains a local file '[tmp_root]/acceptance-test-lease'
    which is a potential copy of the remote lease. tmp_root is /tmp/lease
    by default.  You can optionally specify a different tmp_root
    using the hidden '-l' option described above, but always specify the
    same tmp_root across all steps.

    This script also maintains a lease record in the remote kubernetes
    cluster in a config map named 'acceptance-test-lease' that's
    located in the default namespace.

    The lease record contains multiple fields to help identify
    the last user of the lease.  It also contains a 'timestamp'
    field which equals 0 when the lease is unowned, and which
    is set to the last time the lease was updated when the lease
    is owned (in seconds since the epoch - e.g. 'date +%s').
