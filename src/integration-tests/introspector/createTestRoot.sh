# This script runs in a pod via krun.sh, it sets up the top
# level directory for this test that in turn is mounted as /shared by the
# test's wl-pvc, wl-pv, and wl-pod yamlt (plus similar 'mysql' yamlt).

# The 'acceptance_test_pv' directory it creates matches the directory
# expected by the integration test 'cleanup.sh' script.

# The 'pv-root' directory is mounted in the krun.sh command line.  It physically
# corresponds to the PV_ROOT env var path specified as an input to the test.
