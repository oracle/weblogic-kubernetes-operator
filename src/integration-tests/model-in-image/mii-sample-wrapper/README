Introduction
------------

This directory contains standalone 'wrapper' scripts for automating the model-in-image sample. These scripts are NOT part of the sample - they're used by the test framework to encapsulate and automate testing of the sample, and they're used by a local 'generate' script to generate commands and yaml for the sample source and documentation.

When modifying these scripts, make sure (a) the test programs that depend on them continue to work, (b) that you try not to add dependencies on any test framework.

Globals & Defaults
------------------

WORKDIR ::: sample/target directory
  Default '/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir'.

DOMAIN_UID ::: Domain UID
  Default 'sample-domain1'. 

DOMAIN_NAMESPACE ::: Domain Namespace
  Default is 'sample-domain1-ns'.

CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME ::: WebLogic Domain Name
  This is the configured WebLogic domain name (not the domain UID). The domain
  name is set at runtime using an '@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@' model macro in
  the model image's model files staged by 'stage-model-image.sh'. The
  environment variable is passed to the model at runtime by the domain resource
  that's generated by 'stage-domain-resource.sh'. Default is 'domain1'.

WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE ::: WDT domain type.
  Set to 'WLS' (default) for a standard WLS domain, 'RestrictedJRF', or 'JRF. 
  This value is used by './build-model-image.sh' as a WIT parameter and
  also to help choose the base image default. It's also used by 
  './stage-domain-resource.sh' to set the 'configuration.model.domainType'
  domain resource field.

BASE_IMAGE_NAME ::: Base image name.
  Used by './build-model-image.sh'.
  Defaults to 'container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic' for the 
  'WLS' WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE, and otherwise defaults to 
  'container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure'.

BASE_IMAGE_TAG ::: Base image tag.
  Defaults to 12.2.1.4. Used by the './build-model-image.sh' script. 

MODEL_IMAGE_BUILD ::: When to build model image.
  Set to 'when-missing' (default) to tell './build-model-image.sh' to skip
  building a model image when MODEL_IMAGE_NAME:MODEL_IMAGE_TAG already
  exists in your docker image cache. Set to 'always' to always build.

MODEL_IMAGE_NAME ::: Model image name.
  Used for the model image that's generated by './build-model-image.sh', 
  and also by the './stage-domain-resource.sh' script to set the
  domain resource 'spec.image' setting. 
  Defaults to 'model-in-image'.

IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME ::: Image pull secret name.
  If set, uncomments domain resource image pull secret stanza and sets
  the secret to the specified value.
  If not set or empty string, defaults the domain resource 
  to a commented out image pull stanza with 'regsecret'

MODEL_IMAGE_TAG ::: Model image tag.
  Defaults to 'WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE-v1'. See MODEL_IMAGE_NAME for more info.

MODEL_DIR ::: Location of staged model files for the model image relative to WORKDIR.
  Location of staged model .zip, .properties, and .yaml files that are
  copied into the model image by the './build-model-image.sh' script.
  Default is:
   'model-images/$(basename $MODEL_IMAGE_NAME)__${MODEL_IMAGE_TAG}'

ARCHIVE_SOURCEDIR ::: Location of archive source dir for the model image relative to WORKDIR
  This is used to create $MODEL_DIR/archive.zip and must
  contain a 'wlsdeploy' directory. Defaults to 'archives/archive-v1'.

INCLUDE_MODEL_CONFIGMAP ::: Tell sample to include a configuration.model.configMap
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' to add a reference to a configMap
  in the domain resource, and to add a configuration.model.secrets reference
  to a secret that's used by the configMap. Also used by './create-secrets.sh' to
  deploy a secret the configMap uses. 
  Valid values are 'false' (default), and 'true'.

http_proxy https_proxy ::: Proxies
  If running behind a proxy, then set as needed to allow curl access
  to github.com. Used by 'stage-tooling.sh'.

DOWNLOAD_WDT ::: When to download the WDT installer zip.
  Set to 'always' to always download WDT even if WORKDIR already has 
  a download, default is 'when-missing'. Used by './stage-tooling.sh'.

WDT_INSTALLER_URL ::: WDT installer URL
  Used by './stage-tooling.sh' to obtain the WDT installer.
  Set to a specific zip loc to download specific version, for example:
   'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/release-1.9.7/weblogic-deploy.zip'
  TBD before releasing 3.0, update example version above to correspond to latest and greatest version - and/or point to where we document the supported version
  Defaults to 'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/latest'

DOWNLOAD_WIT ::: When to download the WIT installer zip.
  Set to 'always' to always download WIT even if WORKDIR already has 
  a download, default is 'when-missing'. Used by './stage-tooling.sh'.

WIT_INSTALLER_URL ::: WIT installer URL
  Used by './stage-tooling.sh' to obtain the WIT installer.
  Set to zip loc to download specific version, for example:
   'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-1.9.5/imagetool.zip'
  Defaults to 'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/latest'

DOMAIN_RESOURCE_TEMPLATE ::: Domain resource template
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' as a template for generating a domain
  resource yaml files in WORKDIR. Relative to SCRIPTDIR. Defaults to 
  'mii-domain.yaml.template-WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE'

DOMAIN_RESOURCE_FILENAME ::: Domain resource filename
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' as a target for generating a domain
  resource yaml file in WORKDIR. Relative to WORKDIR. Defaults to 
  'domain-resources/mii-DOMAIN_UID.yaml'

INTROSPECTOR_DEADLINE_SECONDS ::: Introspector timeout for JRF runs
  Defaults to 300.

DB_NAMESPACE ::: Namespace for Oracle DB

?DB_NODEPORT ::: Nodeport for Oracle DB
