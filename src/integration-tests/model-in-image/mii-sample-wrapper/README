This directory contains stand-alone 'wrapper' scripts for automating the model-in-image sample. These scripts are NOT part of the sample - they're used by the test framework to encapsulate and automate testing of the sample, and they're used by a local 'generate' script to generate commands and yaml that can be cut and pasted into the documentation.

When modifying these scripts, make sure (a) the test programs that depend on them continue to work, (b) that you try not to add dependencies on any test framework.
